A Republican strategy to counter the reelection of Obama
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud 
However the Brennan Centre considers this a myth stating that electoral fraud is rarer in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning 
One thing is certain these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout 
In this sense the measures will partially undermine the American democratic system 
Unlike in Canada the American States are responsible for the organisation of federal elections in the United States 
The new election laws require voters to show a photo ID card and proof of US citizenship 
Furthermore these laws also reduce early voting periods invalidate the right to register as a voter on election day and withdraw the right to vote of citizens with a criminal record 
Indiana was the first State to impose such a requirement 
The Republican authorities were quick to extend this practice to other States 
It is important to note that unlike Quebec American citizens do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card 
And it often costs over a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card 
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people minorities and people with low incomes 
And thats not all 
Students voters considered to be voting more for Democratic candidates are not allowed in several States to use the photo ID card issued by their institution 
On the other hand these same States allow fishing or hunting club members who vote more Republican to use the cards issued by these clubs when they vote 
Arizona was the first to introduce such a requirement 
These measures are clearly intended to limit the Hispanic vote 
However it appears that two out of three Hispanic voters favour the Democratic party 
In addition they limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register 
These restrictions are not without consequence 
In addition Republican legislators have enacted laws in five other States aimed at reducing the early voting period 
The same applied to Hispanics 
Of course Democratic legislators and their supporters vigorously opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration 
Several bills were blocked by vetoes of Democratic governors 
The United States Attorney General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws 
They were able to partially limit the damage 
But one thing is certain these new provisions will have a negative impact on the turnout 
In this sense the measures will partially undermine the American democratic system 
Prostate cancer screening take the test or not 
Indeed the PSA test sometimes shows erroneous results with false negative or even false positive results which involve unnecessary medical interventions 
Enough to make already reluctant men hesitate to take screening tests 
Take the test or not 
We asked two specialists for their opinion 
In studies conducted in the United States there was a lot of contamination between control groups so it is difficult to interpret the data and make firm recommendations 
Another study this time a European one concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who were screened and those who were not 
AfricanAmerican men are also more at risk 
The key is to make the right decision once cancer has been detected 
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent 
The patient really needs to be made to understand the degree of risk of his cancer by offering him the options available not necessarily treating prostate cancers that are not longterm life threatening and opting instead in such cases for active monitoring of the disease 
Today many men in whom cancer has been detected will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and is not life threatening 
Active monitoring will be suggested and if the disease progresses they will be offered treatment 
More and more specific criteria are being determined in order to decide who should or should not be treated 
Therefore I recommend taking the test 
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether or not to take it 
Preventing the disease
Unfortunately there is no miracle recipe for preventing cancer 
Despite the progress in research the adoption of healthy living habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it 
Some are also completely unexplained 
For the Canadian Cancer Society the fight against tobacco remains a priority despite the decrease in the number of smokers 
It is also a risk factor for a number of others 
This massively damages peoples health 
Weight
Overweight and obesity are also conducive to the onset of the disease according to the SCC 
They can increase the risks of cancer of the breast colon and rectum oesophagus pancreas and uterus 
Diet
The organisation also recommends limiting your consumption of red meat 
In large amounts it increases the risks of developing colorectal cancer 
Likewise so do cured meat products and these should be avoided 
The conservation of meat by smoking drying or curing can cause the formation of carcinogens 
Vitamins
In recent years a number of scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer 
For the time being however their research is inconclusive 
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory according to the SCC 
While one study noted a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer another noted an increase 
Also the effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clear 
In addition Mr Beaulieu emphasises the importance of discussing your concerns and family history with your doctor 
The Higgs boson revealed
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson created quite a stir last summer and with good reason 
Indeed it is believed that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe no less 
But for physicists it is still not completely sure that it really is the Higgs 
We know without a shadow of a doubt that it is a new authentic particle and greatly resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model 
In addition new data unveiled this week at a large physics Congress in Kyoto seem to confirm this but there are still insufficient data to be perfectly sure 
But lets suppose that it really is the Higgs since the chances of being mistaken seem slim and see what it is 
In our world there is a fatally unavoidable law which states that two things cannot meet at the same place at the same time 
Theres no way to break this rule and dont try too hard youll go mad 
Based on this physicists classify particles into two categories 
In one corner we have good citizens called fermions who wisely obey the Pauli principle 
While lurking in the other are the bosons a nasty band of anarchists who respect nothing at all events not this principle which means that they can indeed be found in the same place at the same time 
These bosons it must be stressed here are not all such exotic bugs as you might think 
More stable field
Now this Higgs field is much much more stable than the electromagnetic field to excite it it is necessary to achieve very very high energy levels rather like a frozen pond which would need a very large rock to wrinkle the surface 
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful for explaining the relationship between the Higgs and mass 
In fact not all particles or all materials interact with the electromagnetic field 
Some such as magnets do so but others dont a piece of paper for example will never stick to a fridge 
And likewise not all particles interact with the Higgs field those that do so have mass while the others such as the photon do not 
For science it serves to check the validity of the Standard Model SM and also allows physicians to examine any discrepancies between the observations and predictions of the SM 
But to date no such discrepancies have been found at CERN 
Repercussions
The repercussions of this research on the daily life of the man in the street are more difficult to predict but it would be wrong to assume that there wont be any 
They had an inkling of the scientific applications but nothing as to the rest 
Just imagine 
And then applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds research 
This does not of course mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives but it does mean that actually you never know 
With its Dying with Dignity Commission Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life 
The debate is due to resume shortly as a bill is being prepared 
However in this vital area much remains to be done 
Le Devoir attempted to look more closely 
Just a few weeks ago Mr L lived alone in his Montrgie apartment 
The festering prostate cancer had allowed him a twoyear respite 
The disease is doing its work huge weakness which prevents him going to the toilet alone and even eating alone 
Sitting in front of an appetising lunch he consents to being helped to eat resigned 
Courageous he even manages to smile talks to the strangers bustling around him bringing him his medication offering him a bath 
The courage of ordinary death 
A few hours later the team found a cure for this illness 
Regressing to the stage of a child for some people is an unacceptable humiliation 
Because in the opinion of a number of people working in palliative care great moments occur at the very heart of such regression 
Patients at the VictorGadbois palliative care home all suffer from cancer 
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months 
But the disease has made me discover my children 
She looks forward nevertheless in the next few days to a last visit by her son coming from Italy 
At VictorGadbois a group of volunteers provides bodily care and help with feeding 
This is palliative care given when there is nothing else that can be done 
To make death more comfortable 
This is very few when we know that we will all die one day 
Here life continues under the best possible conditions explains Dr Christiane Martel one of the doctors at the home 
Whether at a physical comfort emotional or spiritual level 
A person who is dying will accept being helped to drink brandy or Pepsi whatever is their tipple 
Diabetics no longer need to control their blood sugar 
And death is part of everyday life 
Yesterday evening a beer was served to Mr X who died during the night 
This morning it is his son who will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased 
At the VictorGadbois home one day follows another but no two are alike 
Lack of access to palliative care
And a number of organisations such as the VictorGadbois home and the Palliative Care Society in Greater Montreal specialise more or less exclusively in care provided to cancer patients 
It is precisely this large gap in Quebec health care which has made a number of palliative care physicians fear the adoption of a law on euthanasia and assisted suicide 
Since October a manifesto signed by palliative care luminaries including Dr Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative 
According to Dr Christiane Martel the Quebec health system is not effective enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality palliative care before it is accepted to proceed to euthanasia 
Im afraid that patients ask to die because they dont receive adequate care 
And at the same time some oncologists work relentlessly on their patients until the last day despite the worst prognoses 
Hlne Richards survival hopes were already minimal when she ended her gruelling chemotherapy 
When I announced to my oncologist that I was stopping the treatment she told me she regretted that I had given up fighting she said 
However she had told me I was finished 
No allpowerful care
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely allpowerful in the treatment of pain 
At the very end of life physicians then often resort to palliative sedation which is equivalent to putting the patient to sleep until the time of death either sporadically or permanently 
We can no longer pretend not to understand this part of their suffering 
Increasingly an unrelieved patient will have the option of having such palliative sedation 
This report was made possible thanks to a journalism award from the Canada health research institutes 
Widespread real estate scandals in Quebec
In recent weeks it has conducted a series of searches and brought charges of fraud and corruption against municipal politicians such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte Mayor of a suburban town 
Next on the list is apparently Gilles Vaillancourt who has just resigned from his post as Mayor of Laval third largest city in Quebec 
He is suspected of pocketing repeated bribes in exchange for public contracts 
Others formally accused are Montreal highway engineers and Italian entrepreneurs including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito 
He also admitted having organised an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal DeputyPrime Minister Nathalie Normandeau 
Sewer contracts with inflated costs
Then an organiser of the Mayors party Martin Dumont accused Mr Tremblay of having deliberately closed his eyes to a parallel budget feeding his coffers with dirty money 
Following these revelations Mr Tremblay resigned in early November plunging Montreal into a major crisis 
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first women in Montreal to raise the alarm 
The wound is being cleaned but Montreal would need its own investigative unit with ongoing monitoring to avoid the return of these questionable practices 
How to clean house 
Properly 
Although this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal Mr Duchesneau invites anyone laughing to look in their own backyard 
This season you have taken on a new stature with PSG 
How do you explain this progression 
It can be explained by individual awareness but also by the new dimension of PSG 
Some great players have arrived 
Every day Im making progress alongside them 
The technical staff has also brought me a lot 
Day by day all these things help me raise my level of play 
And in a match its easier 
Everything moves very fast in football 
But I dont get worked up 
From my debut at the Clairefontaine INF pretraining centre to my transfer to SaintEtienne Ive always moved step by step 
So you benefit from the competition brought in by Carlo Ancelotti 
This summers recruits are used to playing matches at a high level 
They also know that every training session is crucial 
Which is what makes a player like me want to face up and give my best 
On the other hand Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot as regards my position 
Hes supported by deputies like Claude Makelele who played in the same position as me 
Is Ancelotti the man for the job 
Definitely 
Ancelotti inspires respect among all the experts 
He has masses of experience and has won many titles with top clubs 
Hes worked with great players 
I think he will bring more titles to Paris 
In January I had an encouraging discussion with him 
I was just coming back from a series of injuries 
The confidence he gives me also explains my performance 
What importance do you attach to the first part of the season for PSG 
But were waiting on the sidelines 
What is the clubs goal in this competition 
Well try to go as far as possible 
From now on anything can happen 
But well have something to say against some very good European teams 
Can PSG become a top European club in the short term 
It already has the budget 
To become a top European club Paris needs to win titles and keep it up over time 
Today this isnt the case 
Financially PSG has the means to make it happen 
Definitely it would be a major disappointment 
This year were really committed to winning the championship 
We werent far away last season 
In May there was great disappointment because we were good enough to finish first 
It was a terrific season 
But another team Montpellier had an even more fantastic season 
I think this is the year 
Even if big teams like Marseille Lyon and Bordeaux are competing for the title I think we have the weapons to win 
Do you think the media expect too much of PSG 
Its normal for them to expect a lot from us given whats been invested and the players we have 
We totally accept it 
You wonder what more people expect 
Were not FC Barcelona 
Were trying to implement a game project 
It takes time to build a team 
The Champions League proved we could hold our own 
That would be to ignore our opponents and the French Championship 
I hope that in May we will be able to smile in saying that despite all the difficulties we finally did it 
PSG seem totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic 
This means Ibrahimovic is very successful and scores a lot of goals 
Hes demonstrated everywhere he went that he was a great player a world star 
Within the group we respect the man and the player 
And also he respects the men he has around him 
What he has done is truly exceptional 
It pushes others to raise their level of play 
Thiago Silva who is one of the best defenders in the world also helps everyone else progress 
A disappointment 
I really wanted to play in this Euro 
Unfortunately my injury prevented me from getting any game time 
I saw some things there and came out stronger 
Today Im playing well in selection matches 
Which is what Ive been hoping for since my baptism with the Blues 
Ive learned the lessons from what happened in the Ukraine and I now owe it to myself to have exemplary behaviour 
What do think about Didier Deschampss first few months in charge of the Blues 
He has the results he wanted 
Were well placed in the World qualifying group 
The coach is tough close to the players and inspires them to win 
Like Laurent Blanc was 
But I dont want to make any comparisons 
Blanc had achieved his goal when we qualified for the Euro 
I hope Didier Deschamps will take the Blues to Brazil 
That match gave us confidence 
Everybody fought for everybody 
Before that shock in Spain Id never experienced such a match in my career 
With Bitcoin pay and sell without banks
The opposite of current monetary exchanges based on central banks identified transactions and processing fees among the parties involved 
In addition as often in these technologies a political vision is palpable the belief that the current monetary system made up of banking monopolies leads to financial crises 
In fact Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto a pseudonym is both a virtual currency but convertible into dollars euros and a secure exchange protocol like BitTorrent which allows peertopeer file exchange 
Close to a thousand web sites accept bitcoins as donations or means of payment 
Nothing very impressive compared to global transactions in real currency or financial products 
However the European Central Bank ECB took an interest in it in a report on virtual currencies published in October 
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currency such as credits used to progress in a video game which you win by playing or which you can buy and sometimes exchange in return 
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system 
But on each occasion a central authority controls and handles the exchanges 
With Bitcoin all nodes in the network are both custodians of the book of accounts auditors currency issuers and buyers and sellers 
How does the network operate 
Each transaction between two users is actually carried out between two electronic addresses like with an email 
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment thereby ensuring anonymity 
A set of information associated with this transaction is signed electronically by a dualkey encryption system 
So the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction 
Using the contents of the file it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist in the public book of accounts broadcast across the entire network 
The key step is entering the new transaction in the book 
It passes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge issued to the computers and the winner a kind of interim central banker will have the privilege of adding this extra line 
This is a file hashing phase ie the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique digital imprint 
The goal being to find the number that gives a special imprint lots of zeros at the beginning 
Once this number has been found the other nodes can easily check that it is the right one 
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all the other transactions any modification would alter the imprint 
If a user wanted to defraud by paying twice with the same money very quickly less than ten minutes only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network the other would remain an orphan because the two have different imprints 
The difficulty of the challenge is also raised with each increase in computing power 
The life of the network has had its ups and downs 
Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in deposits stolen 
The ECB also highlights the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service 
But cash also has this weakness 
Major players like Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature 
Others such as the WordPress blog platform accept them 
Pierre Noizat also author of an educational book on this currency has a lot of faith in the potential of this technology as a transaction network 
His system Paytunia is equivalent to a credit card in real money or a contactless payment by mobile but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions which are thus cheaper 
Also the user manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous 
The system is easy to implement by merchants who do not need to install new terminals or software 
There is a general movement to reappraise hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems 
The ECB in its report says it will reassess the various risks currently regarded as high in the event of the currencys success 
We got out of Afghanistan 
What now 
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan Kapisa and Surobi 
It is time for the Afghan army to resume possession of its territory and the Afghan people to choose their future without expecting us to do everything 
It is mainly Afghan peasants that we have punished by regarding them as terrorists 
The Taliban is composed of foreign extremists former leaders in refuge in Pakistan but often peasants who refuse the presence of foreign armed forces like in the time of the Soviets 
They want to defend their traditions both ancient and archaic even though they have been joined by Jihadists Pakistanis Arabs Uzbeks Tajiks 
Tolerated sometimes assisted by local insurgents the latter will no longer be so when Westerners become more scarce 
The departure of French troops from the Nijrab base which I observed from the top of hills of almond trees planted with French funding was carried out in an orderly fashion 
Convoys of trucks and armoured vehicles reached Kabul without being attacked overflown by helicopters 
At that time Kabul was empty the country being torn apart by the struggles between different factions 
Their takeover of the country had been perceived then as a sort of liberation a return to safety 
Afghanis paid the price of the obscurantism of these peasants by the organisation of AlQaeda but their situation has not improved today 
Former Mujahidin the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are allied in the desire to keep women in an inferior position 
They became profiteers seizing government land to resell as building land to refugees returning from Iran and Pakistan benefiting from huge American outsourcing contracts 
They have become discredited what is more most of them did not fight themselves 
The people as I heard in the countryside want a Government that is not made up of thieves 
Many young people want to leave as those who were able to benefit from American largesse will leave the flight of capital is considerable 
The young people are tired of war and its ideologies 
They have rubbed shoulders with the modern world during their exile in Iran or Pakistan and appreciated the benefits 
In towns and cities the state schools are full with girls and boys alike 
It will be necessary to provide work for those young people who no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or the corruption of certain leaders 
All of them including the armed opponents are partial to mobile phones television with its Turkish soap operas that show a modern world is followed everywhere 
The army is now present 
Will the authorities who command it be considered legitimate 
Former commanders of the antiSoviet struggle are already thinking about restoring provincial militias which will escape the central power 
No industries have been reestablished no dams are in good condition no major irrigation systems have been repaired 
Everything is imported nothing is produced apart from fruit and vegetables 
The Priority is left to private initiative 
In a country ruined by thirty years of war government control over the infrastructure would have been necessary 
The rumour was spread that Afghanistan had huge mineral wealth 
This only added to the feeling that the Westerners were only there to seize it 
With no energy to process the iron ore or copper on site or means of transport to export it across the mountains there is no mining 
The Chinese have already almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine leaving international archaeologists funded by the World Bank to search the huge Buddhist site and remain the largest employers in the province 
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan on which imports and exports largely depend to restore normal relations 
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid girls high school boys high school French Department at the University French Institute cooperation in the military legal medical and agricultural fields support to the archaeological Delegation 
These projects involving large numbers of local labour have helped to contain the insurgency irrigation wells drinking water reforestation fruit trees soil protection and increase in cultivable areas 
What will we leave as a souvenir after two billion euros of military spending 
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from local communities in Kapisa province 
To be in a position to free themselves from the uprising led by foreign groups which is what farmers told me they want a small amount of civil aid should be maintained in their favour well controlled and directly affecting them 
A Constitution by force in Egypt
A new gamble for President Mohammed Morsi 
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration which temporarily grants him full powers he has decided to go for broke 
Taking everyone by surprise he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the following day 
Just a week ago the head of State had given the Assembly two more months to finish its work 
For two years Egypt has relied on a provisional text amended several times and this has weakened institutional stability and led to legal imbroglios 
This new initiative has only served to enhance the divide in the country 
His supporters affirm that this is the quickest way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis by speeding up the transition process 
A referendum is due to be held within the next two weeks 
A very short period which forces the Brothers to abandon their plan to explain the text article by article to the Egyptians 
For the President it is also a way to achieve popular and democratic legitimacy while the dispute rages throughout the country 
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote favourably as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time 
Most of the liberals were missing 
In midNovember shortly before the constitutional declaration they had slammed the door feeling they had failed to assert their views 
Representatives of human rights religious minorities or civil society had done likewise 
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood 
Not surprisingly the articles were for the most part voted unanimously 
Commentators were also amused that one of the only diversions of the day was expressed with regard to the hour of prayer some Committee members feeling that the Constituent Assembly clock was wrong 
For the Islamists the fact that this article was not amended is a guarantee of their goodwill and their respect for the other elements of Egyptian society 
Because in their opinion Islamisation of the Constitution is done through other articles 
The liberals fears are also fuelled by the fact that the next Rector of the university will probably be much less moderate than the current one 
With this Constitution things remain under civil rule 
Beyond its religious aspect the text voted on yesterday is highly criticised due to the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic 
The Muslim Brothers argue that they are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the former regime 
Another issue the powers conferred on the army 
In accordance with the wishes of the military the Defence budget review will be not submitted to Parliament but to a National Defence Council 
Nor will trials of civilians will be banned in military tribunals as requested by associations for the defence of human rights 
Who also voice their concerns about the text which they consider repressive 
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and insults are now prohibited which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression particularly for the press 
In addition no longer does any of the articles refer to the protection of women highlights Heba Morayef from Human Rights Watch 
The word was not included in the previous Constitution 
While the Egyptian President was speaking yesterday evening on television demonstrations are planned for this afternoon 
Supporters of the Head of State will march on Saturday 
In Israel holy places await Ukrainian tourists the omphalos and a sea of saline water
The Holy Land combines the splendour of biblical truths modern comfort and primeval nature 
Lets worship the holy places
It is worth visiting the River Jordan where Jesus was baptized 
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his magic turned water into wine at a wedding walked on water calmed a storm and filled the nets 
This is also where Jesus came before his disciples and after the resurrection 
But the biggest number of holy places is in Jerusalem 
Believers walk through the Way of Grief or Via Dolorosa 
It starts by the Antonia Fortress Praetorium where the judgement took place and brings us along the streets of the Old Town to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Golgotha the place of the crucifixion Stone of Unction and the place of Jesus burial 
This is also the location of the symbolic Christian omphalos which symbolizes the salvation of mankind 
The Holy Cross Monastery in Jerusalem is erected at the site that according to Christian legend yielded the tree used to make the cross for Jesus crucifixion 
According to tradition people of different faiths leave notes here with their wishes which are then fulfilled 
Travel along a vertical
They can be reached on foot only by those who are into mountain climbing 
Others are delivered to this historical mountaintop by a cableway 
A shuttle bus brings people to it from the foot of the mountain 
According to an ancient legend pagan gods used to live on the mountain 
Visit unique museums
You wont be able to visit all of them on one trip
But at least the five most interesting ones are worth a visit 
Among them Museum of Israel located close to Knesset Parliament 
The Museum of Art in TelAviv is also interesting 
Its exhibits include a wide range of impressionists and expressionists like Monet Pissarro Renoir Sisley Cezanne Matisse Modigliani Chagall Picasso 
In Akko you can visit the bath museum AlBasha which consists of several rooms of ancient Turkish baths with models of visitors and bath attendants of the time 
In Caesarea it is worth visiting the unique private Ralli Museum where you can enjoy the sculptures of Dali and Rodin 
There are no tour guides or gift shops 
Entry is free of charge and contributions are strictly not allowed 
The fifth one is the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in TelAviv which tells one of the most dramatic stories in history 
You go in and find yourself in complete darkness 
Stars are glimmering 
and you listen to names of Jewish children and countries where they died 
Ukraine is mentioned there too 
Wellness
There are three resort areas in Israel located on the coasts of the Mediterranean Red and Dead Seas 
Each have swimming pools aqua parks dolphinaria and oceanaria 
The Dead Sea is even warmer and people swim in it all year round 
Its azure water is saline and easily keeps you afloat even if you dont know how to swim 
The surrounding landscapes are surreal in their beauty 
People come here to undergo a course of treatment using salt water wraps and medicinal muds and to improve their health if they have dermatitis allergies asthmas eczemas arthritis bronchitis or diabetes or to return emotional balance 
Touch the mysteries of antiquity
They are preserved in the old section of TelAviv in the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean Sea 
The famous sea route connecting Egypt Syria Anatolia and Mesopotamia runs through it 
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends 
According to legends this is where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beauty Andromeda with whom he lived a long and happy life 
Tourists really like to wander the narrow streets named after signs of the zodiac 
They say if you touch the walls on the street of your sign fortune will come to you 
In Jaffa you can meet newlyweds who come from all over Israel and even from other countries for photo sessions 
During the Roman period Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prefects including Pontius Pilate 
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances 
A note for the tourist
City transportation is mainly buses but Jerusalem has a highspeed tram and Haifa has the only subway line in the country comprising six stops and connecting upper town with lower 
In essence it is an underground cable railway 
According to the Jewish tradition Sabbath is celebrated in Israel 
Between Friday evening and the sunset on Saturday markets stores and public transportation stop working 
The work week starts on Sunday morning 
Many cafes restaurants and hotels have only kosher food with no pork seafood fish with no scales or dishes that combine milk with meat 
There is a wide selection of dishes from lamb and beef soups and desserts cooked using coconut milk traditional Jewish hummus paste various sauces falafel balls made of ground chickpeas fruits and vegetables 
The streets of Israel dont have homeless dogs 
But there are many wellfed cats which walk around lazily 
In the evening they can even be seen sleeping on roofs of parked cars 
These pussycats like busy places and do not refuse treats 
In numbers
Visitors and holidaymakers arrive mostly from the USA Russia France Germany Italy England and Ukraine 
While deputies and human rights activists argue about the purpose of the law on mandatory language testing the country already has scam artists who sell fake certificates 
Mostly these are citizens of Central Asia Uzbekistan Tajikistan and Turkmenistan 
Their only goal is to earn money to support families back home 
For the moment this law applies only to those who intend to work in services housing and utility services household services and retail 
But with time as promised by the Federal Migration Service tests will become mandatory for all nonresidents 
In addition to language Russian history and basics of the legal system will be tested 
Language knowledge will have to be confirmed both to receive and to extend the work permit 
An exception is in effect only for citizens of countries where Russian is a state language 
Purpose doomed fate and the protection of rights
Seven testing points will be operating under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language Peoples Friendship University of Russia Moscow State University MGU St Petersburg State University SPbGU and other Russian education institutions 
The initiative to introduce the testing was supported by State Duma members and the Federal Migration Services 
But human rights activists asked the question repeatedly in the press before the law came into force what will it actually achieve 
What will the obligation to know Russian change for the Russians and for the nonresidents 
First of all according to representatives of the migration service this will allow to reduce the number of people suffering from labour slavery 
Many speak about protection of the rights of work migrants explains the Head of the representative office of the Federal Migration Services of Russia Viktor Sebelev 
Rights protection should begin before their departure 
Migrants without profession education who do not know Russian who do not have a medical certificate start to have problems 
We receive many complaints from our migrants 
Not be angry boss 
Nonetheless many citizens of Central Asian countries who plan to go to work in Russia admit that not only their understanding of the language of the country where they are going is not good but they can barely write in their own language 
Naturally this is not so much their fault but due to poverty very few Turks Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford even a basic education 
Their families dont even have food to feed their children not to mention decent clothing shoes and supplies 
After reaching adolescence these kids go to work at the first opportunity 
It is hard if language knowledge is bad they admit 
But human rights activists note one important point about the law on language 
Testing will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status 
If they have no status there will be no testing nor any official work in the future 
In the meantime most of the migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally 
Many of the foreigners assert that receiving official status in our country is not that easy 
The reason lies in bureaucratic hurdles and the already mentioned language difficulties 
Whereas a fake registration is done quickly and costs only one and a half thousand 
Officers of the Russian Police know that we mainly have fake papers without registration hence the extortion 
On the first day of the laws entry into effect it turned out that not only migrant registration documents can be fake 
A few forged certificates about passing language tests have been seized by Federal Migration Services officers already 
Forged documents are printed on a standard colour printer 
Naturally they were not free for their owners each of the migrants who had hoped to facilitate the task of passing the tests in this way paid seven thousand rubles for them 
It is two and a half times more than the process of official testing which costs three thousand 
Government officials and human rights activists agree that the main goal in the near future is to protect the system from corruption so that the certificates could not just be bought 
For the moment the authorities can promise migrant workers who could not pass the test the first time to give time to complete a basic language course 
In addition those who come without Russian language knowledge will be offered work in areas that do not require active communication with people 
The Ministry of the Interior does not put arms from the illegal market back into circulation
The share of crime involving legal weapons is extremely low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is proposing to toughen up the law for owners of civil weapons 
This is the reaction of authorities to recent incidents CLICK shots at weddings where there were no casualties and the massacre staged by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov resulting in CLICK the death of seven people 
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Safety and AntiCorruption Irina Yarovaya who promised that the amendments to the law on weapons will be brought to the State Duma in the near future 
The percentage of crime involving registered weapons is minimal said criminal lawyer Vasily Lesnikov to BBC Russia 
According to them one can find any weapon at a low price right now 
Nonetheless the Ministry of the Interior asserts that the situation of the spread of illegal arms is under control 
Suppliers from plants to officers
Screenshot of the site that accepts orders for weapons 
Baranets explains that this covers weapons taken from police warehouses and those stolen directly from law enforcement agencies employees 
Illegal arms are taken to be sold from military warehouses 
Explosions have often been heard at military warehouses 
Manufacturers of weapons make their contribution according to Baranets 
An especially high number of guns and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan 
Where do the weapons come from 
Experts analysed the reports of the Department of the Interior and Rosstat criminology literature and open data from portals on weapons 
The overwhelming majority of illegal weapons according to the researchers comes from the military and security forces 
According to him dealers go to the military warehouse for a new batch of goods 
One piece for example a TT gun can be bought from a warrant officer 
It is issued to him and given through the fence 
The buyer and seller often find each other through friends 
I found out the price of the weapon only there
military commentator Viktor Baranets
To get a weapon I need someone with connections says the sales consultant I have an acquaintance but Im not sure its reliable 
Right now even if I need a few knuckledusters I get them through someone I trust 
He also supplies them only to me because he knows that I wont give him away 
Beginners look for weapons in different ways 
The formulas are still the same according to him 
According to Baranets the buyer is not offered a pig in a poke you can try out everything 
I the potential client am not just buying we go to the forest with the seller and set a target there 
Store on a sofa
No documents or personal meetings are needed 
Users leave their requests and ask questions 
Can a minor buy 
Federal Security Service now spread a big network of fake sites and there are tons of potential buyers of military weapons 
People come like hungry fish to bait and then mine coal in Siberia 
military commentator and former military man Viktor Baranets
I heard about this normally the site is registered outside the area of applicability of the laws of Russia 
People accept orders 
The buyer pays at an ATM 
Viktor Baranets confirms that after leaving a request on the site you can stay without a weapon and go to jail 
The Federal Security Service now spreads a big network of fake sites and there are tons of potential buyers of military weapons 
The wait time is a month to a month and a half 
It is shipped from longterm storage warehouses by the midlevel management of these warehouses 
Fastfood and supermarket workers are on strike in the USA
Up to a fourth of all American teenagers have worked the cash register at McDonalds at one time or another
In the last few days there is a wave of protest actions in the USA against low salaries in supermarkets of the Walmart chain and popular fast food chain restaurants like McDonalds Burger King Taco Bell Wendys and Kentucky Fried Chicken 
Right now nobody is able to predict whether this wave will turn into the ninth wave or it is destined to fizzle out early 
Actions are being supported by unions and a series of leftwing organizations 
In addition to increasing the low wages received by employees of Walmart and fast food chains the goal of the protesters is to create unions within them 
This sector of the economy is not covered by any union movement yet 
Actions began last week after Thanksgiving on Black Friday when massive sales drew millions of people in America sometimes accompanied by clashes 
Walmart sells everything imaginable from diapers hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners eggs and milk 
So many lowpaid Walmart employees shop only at their workplace 
Availability and assortment made Walmart one of the biggest American corporations 
According to critics Walmart can afford to sell the products cheaply partly because it pays little to its employees 
These latter also complain about hard work conditions for example lack of lift trucks and handheld scanners 
Walmart supporters happily note that the protests took place in nine states and did not cause any damage at all to the corporation 
Protests continued this week in New York where their object was not Walmart theyre not so welcome in the progressive city that is why they dont exist here yet but McDonalds and other cheap restaurants 
McDonalds says that it sells billions of portions and despite this it doesnt even give you sick days or pay you for honest work 
Jumaane Williams member of the City Council of New York
Nobody earns less in this expensive city 
I cannot understand how one can survive in New York on this money 
Once upon a time almost a fourth of American teenagers went through McDonalds working parttime after school living with parents 
Few saw this as a source of living or planned to stay there for long 
Now I continuously come across interviews with McDonalds employees who complain that they have to survive on this salary and sometimes even feed their children 
On the other hand there is a comment on the Wall Street Journal forum whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how you will feed them 
They also demanded the creation of unions in the fast food industry 
American law prohibits the administration from preventing this or punishing activists of the union movement by nagging or firing 
On the other hand the administration does not often ease their life 
But for objective reasons it is hard to cover fast food with a union 
One of them is the unusual turnover of employees 
Disagreeing
Noisy protests began on this day in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan 
According to the New York Times this was the biggest action of this kind in the history of the American fast food industry 
But only a few hundred people took part in it and many of them were not fast food employees which comprise tens of thousands of people in New York 
It is unclear right now whether this will spark a mass movement 
Among modern technology fans a popular topic is augmented reality lately seen primarily through the prism of special glasses 
At first a functional model was shown by Google in the summer at its annual conference Then in November it was announced that Microsoft filed an application for patent too 
They are drawn by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands creating virtual open spaces 
 Please tell us in simple terms about the work your research group does 
 We work on the interaction of people with machines at the same time trying to expand the boundaries of this interaction 
While people in general are stuck at working with pixels on a flat screen and sometimes pointing fingers at them 
For example Xbox and Kinect sensors are a step forward Almost no Xbox is sold without Kinect today because everyone likes control by gestures 
 What else awaits us in the future 
Information entry has improved the system receives more data but output still needs to get better 
We are trying to change this working on truly threedimensional display systems based on various technologies including projection technologies 
We need to let the computer world into our physical world make it more tangible 
But for this we need to identify both the user and the space around him 
Then we will be able to supplement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form 
Above all get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets 
 What do you think about voice control 
Its a popular thing but is it overestimated 
 It clearly cannot be called a cureforall theres a question of privacy because we do not always want to let the others know about our actions and intentions 
In reality all types of interaction with computers are good but each in their own niche 
For example we had a project to control devices in public places in which we thought about movements not wide movements but small reserved ones 
Movements were not recorded by a camera but by a hand bracelet that determined the movement of bones and muscles 
Its big right now but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a hand watch 
In general the future lies in the mixed control eg movement voice 
 What do you mean 
 For example how would you ask me to give you this bottle of water 
You will talk and show at the same time 
 Usually I just say 
 Oh that will be very hard to detect 
 So you want to make the users adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at that moment 
 Not necessarily but it is a mutual approximation 
I think in the near future we will mainly work on developing new sensors that will enable more precise determination of a persons reaction 
This could be eg laser sensors They have a decent depth resolution which is very important 
 If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors what are your complaints about modern cameras 
Not enough resolution depth or something else 
 In general the current generation is what we can base ourselves on in working on threedimensional recognition 
Its not just the mega pixels though but the quality of the matrix and the depth 
From the latter point of view all current technologies are not good enough for us this adds work to the algorithm designers 
So its important to remember about the resolution on the X Y but also the Z axis 
Speed the number of images per second is also very important 
Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction between man and machine 
In my work it would be very useful to have a device that does not require touching and would have more images per second 
 Does the number of cameras need to be increased 
 In Kinect there are three cameras now one of which is actually an infrared emitter and the second one the recipient of the signal 
The third one is actually a regular sensor of visible range 
It is not applied to determine the objects depth 
Potentially a large number of cameras could solve the problem 
Or make it worse by increasing the required volume of calculations 
It would be nice to create a flexible analogue Kinect play with the flexion of camera disposition and see how this will help in threedimensional determination of the position 
 As far as I remember Microsoft did not present its glasses to the public unlike Google 
Dont you think this is one of the most promising platforms from the point of view the everyday use of augmented reality technologies 
Glasses are a very personal device that is their strength private things are seen only by you and at the same time their weakness augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people 
 Let us imagine for a minute that manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from Ironman but to a regular person 
There is one problem with this idea that the critics often point out no tactile feedback 
Hands feel nothing 
What answers does your group prepare to this challenge 
 In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh consecutive attempt at the interaction between man and machine 
I think that the eighth will probably be the addition of tactile sensations 
For now one of the interesting tricks is to use the second hand as a sort of matrix for the image 
It is great at registering pushes 
There are also wrist bracelets that affect the nerve endings in fingers which is also a promising area 
 Have you tried to deceive the mind 
To force it to think that it feels something that it should be feeling when it sees something 
 This is a good idea and we havent tried this yet 
It conceals one challenge that will not be solved so quickly how to force a person who is physically in a very limited space to believe that he is walking along an open almost limitless space we are working on the concept of treadmills not at all like in clubs moving platforms and giant balloons 
So far deceiving the mind has had limited success theres work for many years to come 
Thats what makes working on virtual reality so attractive to researchers many things are in their very beginnings 
Judgement calls instead of culture Rosbaltru
Rosbalt continues the project St Petersburg Avantgarde dedicated to residents who are ahead in the avantgarde of culture and art 
This top list already includes outstanding figures of the art scene of St Petersburg whose achievements reach beyond the scope of the city often recognized in Europe bypassing fame in Russia 
The new player in Rosbalt the bold artist Kirill Miller 
The whole city knows Kirill Miller a bearded man dressed all in red who can be seen by the Russian Museum or by the Summer Garden or at fashionable parties and shows 
Kirill Millers work always brings in crowds of people no matter where they are exhibited 
Kirill Miller is one of the purely St Petersburg social and philosophical storytellers and creators of new mythology 
Moreover he is a city man who makes people smile on the street and lifts up everyones spirit 
Recently he took up the street organ and became St Petersburgs music man because he was ready for this complex role with all his Bohemian existence philosophy and image 
 Kirill why do you walk around the city all in red not yellow or turquoise for example 
 I chose the colour red as a fashion designer engaged in look and image 
In this world red is a compromise between artist imagemaker and society 
Although in society everything that is not grey causes aggression and agitation of the bad kind 
But my provocations are aimed at starting conversation 
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion 
 When did you realise that you must be an artist 
 At an exhibition in the Nevsky House of Culture where my work was displayed 
It became clear to me that this is my path 
Then the wave of older free unofficial artists was gone while new free artists like me were not understood 
Im drawn to theatre clothing music all genres except for literature 
 And all this has been united in your Artclinic It was important for me to find myself in the centre of the culture of St Petersburg where all the best creative forces should come together 
Many were born there NOMy Tequila Jazz I remember when Shnur was brought there with the Van Goghs Ear project 
Shnur and his friends lip sang easy songs wearing tight leotards and the now trendy composer Igor Vdovin was with them 
When the group began to play live it became Leningrad 
Trakhtenberg was the presenter of many programs before HaliGali times 
We gave them Trakhtenberg and a great career was on its way but the basic education and mentoring he received from us 
That is where our staff and regular customers left for 
I am a hero of the last century when culture meant something 
I was nominated Artist of the Year my climax came to an end 
In the new times it is uncomfortable to work by old rules Im a man of truth honesty and culture of the last century 
In our time it is easy to become popular but culture and popularity are different You can be popular but not very cultural 
 Your work is marked by a recognizable style 
 Many of my works are hits with clearly reflected relevance and acuity 
Clowns are a timeless category 
I was social before now it is painful and scary to be like that 
But everything is blurred in clowns tragedy is removed 
I like grotesque I have grotesque ideas 
For example saving the world by totalitarian changing of clothes by order 
Nowadays people are judged by appearance not their inner qualities 
Who knows maybe you cannot shake his hand and need to spit in his face 
And the lie will go away with the help of changing clothes 
 Recently we saw you in the role of music man A cultural city should have such a character 
Who fits the role better than I 
 Maybe commercial art can also be beautiful 
 Nowadays commercial art should be neat considerate sweet 
There is a disintegration of cultures 
People used to get together in flocks Bohemians liked one thing the simple people something else 
Now everybody is divided into micro societies its hard to be liked by everyone 
I am not a hundred dollar bill to please all 
Now you have to think who you will please 
 But several thousand come to Stas Mikhailov 
 The castouts go to see him the sexualsocial sphere is at work there 
I have fans the main thing is not to betray them not to spoil what I have earned 
In my youth I painted such art that one collector had it hanging on the same wall with Falk and Larionov 
I started with paintings which people usually end with 
Concepts are often mixed up these days 
People say spiritual culture consumer culture 
I am a man of yesterdays culture I grew up on examples of artists who lived poor and died in poverty refused money for the sake of painting 
This is the culture Im for 
 Kirill what is St Petersburg missing 
 Good cultural experts 
There is such a thing an official for culture 
But not everyone can be engaged in culture 
Under the right rulers everything was different Kings may not have understood culture very well but they understood that they needed to stick with the right experts 
There are good consultants in Moscow right now 
Here in St Petersburg there are people who could be experts but they are pushed to the side because more advanced experts are needed who will correctly evaluate these experts and give way to them 
Judgement calls are what thrive now 
Even Erart but theyre different because they say honestly that we dont accept all modern art There are some artists who need to find other museums for themselves 
 What does St Petersburg mean to you 
 St Petersburg is not a cultural capital Moscow has much more culture there is bedrock there 
Its hard for art to grow on our rocks 
We need cultural bedrock but we now have more writers than readers This is wrong 
In Europe there are many curious people who go to art exhibits concerts 
Here this layer is thin 
We need to make art fashionable as it was in the beginning of last century 
The project is supported by the St Petersburg grant 
Give birth in space
The earth is in danger 
Global warming or an encounter with a killer asteroid 
Caravans of cosmic ships with humans on board leave in search of a replacement planet 
To save humanity the question is how to propagate our race in conditions of weightlessness or on that replacement planet 
I think the choice is small 
There are only two actual planets that can be explored even hypothetically 
Life is possible only at a high altitude or on the orbit of Venus in space 
The question of reproduction in space began with flora 
Half a century ago experiments were run on plants 
Four generations of peas grown in orbit were no different from their earth counterparts 
Then insects were bred in orbit small fruit flies 
We get an absolutely normal chick 
But then the problem begins 
Having found no support chicks were tumbling around in disorder 
Chicks did not react to light and sound 
And the problem was that they simply died after four days 
However only samesex beings will be on the Bion biosatellite 
There was an experiment with rats who were sent to space with foetus 
In principle there was nothing extraordinary there 
After landing the cosmic rats had babies 
But its hard to solve the problem of reproduction directly in space 
Its not an easy task 
Animals simply cannot follow their sexual instinct when theyre out of their familiar environment 
In principle people unlike animals can 
Homo sapiens have abstract thinking and are able to create a fitting emotional background 
Such experiments are not conducted for ethical reasons 
The biggest risk was for Tereshkova 
The most valuable thing for humanity is the female body 
Whether she will be able to give birth after this flight 
The childs father Andrian Nikolaev was also a cosmonaut 
However the risk remains 
We have few very few cosmonauts who were OK and had healthy children after long flights 
And yet humanity needs to seek out some new avenues in biotechnologies protection from radiation creation of artificial gravity 
Hydrolaboratory of CPK mandatory phase of training for a flight 
Here cosmonauts practice skills of working in open space in zerogravity conditions 
Water imitates weightlessness 
If for adults water is a foreign medium although comfortable for infants it is a native element 
Small amphibians seem to confirm that life came to land from the ocean 
In principle it is logical because only two weeks pass from birth until the first bathing 
In other words if for a newborn weightlessness is more natural a woman needs gravity earths pull 
Stomach and pelvic muscles usually quickly degenerate in weightlessness the ability to push out the embryo is reduced 
Well lets assume that childbirth stimulators will work out 
Maybe she will push out the baby in a special room 
On the other hand a baby also needs artificial gravity 
When a body does not feel the earths pull it does not form the skeletal and muscular system 
It is not possible to dress a newborn in orbit into a special loading suit for training as they do with adults 
He will simply not have what he needs to survive 
For the moment birth of children in space is just a theory 
However with time it will become reality when earthlings will go to a faraway planet in their ships and it will become the home for their offspring who were born in space 
NKU Head Svarc System audit has failed because of politicians 
The Czech Republic has sound control bodies and a good standard of legislation when it comes to public contracts but it lags behind in their application 
This was said by Miloslav Kala vicepresident of the Supreme Audit Office NKU in an interview for Aktualnecz
Similar conclusions are also reached by the joint audit from the Czech and German auditors 
The Prime Minister recently claimed that the ODS will not be burdening business owners with its checks so is it forbidden or allowed 
At the audit committees session in the House of Deputies you spoke about a joint project between the Czech Republic and Germany within which legislation relating to public contracts in both countries was compared 
What exactly was this about 
This is about parallel auditing which we began around two years ago 
Simply put this is about how European legislation governs the handling of public contracts followed by individual state legislations and then the actual practice itself 
This confirms that creating more and more concise rules is not enough and that attention must be paid to the actual application of these laws 
What does this project actually help you with and what do you think its outcome will bring 
This kind of joint audit could contribute to curtailing these efforts to specify our law to reduce and perfect boundaries when it does not have such a positive impact 
Economy means acquiring the required thing at a reasonable which does not always mean the lowest price so that profiteering and possible criminal proceedings may be avoided 
However just because we have reduced the order limits does not mean something will be procured 
The system might become overloaded with the amount of paperwork and those who wish to look for loopholes in it will be able to take advantage far more easily than if the limits had remained higher 
These are domestic problems about the practical implementation of legislation relating to public contracts 
How does the audit system work in Germany 
Is there an office like the NKU or is it organised differently 
As far as the office is concerned the Bundesrechnungshof functions like our NKU and it is organised like ours it also has a committee although it is appointed slightly differently but basically both offices operate similarly 
Powers are also similar to a degree though of course Germany is organised federally so these courts of auditors are also at the member state levels in this respect their system slightly differs from our own 
The BRH can only audit federal money known to us as state funds 
Public funds which for us are administered by regional and municipal authorities are audited by the federal courts of auditors there 
When it comes to their legislation is it more straightforward than ours 
Overall I would not like to make a comparison without any specific data nevertheless in certain respects Germany serves as an example but it certainly cannot be said that it is better in every aspect 
Is this because perhaps they have better enforcement 
That is certainly not true but again I prefer not to make such comparisons 
It should be said that even in a country we perceive as exemplary they encounter a whole range of problems 
If that were not the case they would gain nothing from working with our office would they 
Coming back to domestic legislation what did the amendment to public contracts legislation mean for your office is its impact being felt already 
The period since the amendment came into force has been quite short so it has not manifested itself in our audit work yet 
Since we carry out our audits expost a certain delay has to be taken into account 
So do you see the adoption of this legislation as a benefit or rather as another burden on the bureaucratic system 
I believe this legislation is a step in the right direction and I hope this will be confirmed 
Under the previous rules parties being audited were already bound by their audit provider for example in the case of regional operational programmes the regional office to the fact that every infringement of public contracts law means a breach of budgetary discipline 
Is it worth constraining the law in this way in that case 
I do not think this is the way 
The system should prevent those who want to attack and abuse it but not penalise those who make a mistake on a technicality which does not affect the final decision 
This kind of system will only increase pressure on bureaucracy 
So how can we get out of this 
Lets see where this deadend takes us 
Is the Svarc System prohibited or allowed 
The Law must be set out one way or the other and if it prohibits something then even the Governments head cannot prevent the work of its department which is dutybound to monitor and enforce 
The law on public contracts has relatively strict rules about the formalities which must be adhered to which is the right way to ensure public tenders are protected 
On the other hand it is a tragedy when a bidder with the best offer is excluded on a technicality 
The Law will never be perfect but its application should be just this is what we are missing in my opinion 
Roads are icy in places but mostly passable 
In several places in the Czech Republic the main roads are icy and snowy 
However the majority of roads are passable with extra care needed in places 
Carlsbad region
In the Carlsbad region the roads have been usable this morning though in some places they were icy and snowy 
The temperature has dropped to between five and ten degrees below zero though it is expected to get warm slightly during the day 
Snowing in the region has stopped and only a thin layer of snow remains in the lowlands 
In some locations there is limited visibility due to mist according to the local highway service 
Caution is of course appropriate for example on certain bridges where the surface can be icy and slippery 
All secondary and tertiary roads are also passable including mountain roads 
In certain stretches of these roads there might be remaining frozen and compacted snow patches 
Above all at higher levels extra care should be taken while driving 
Pardubice and Hradec Kralove region
On some roads in Eastern Bohemia there might be a risk of black ice at higher altitudes and in the mountains there might be a layer of compacted snow according to the Road and Motorway Directorate 
The highway service is warning the drivers against black ice which might occur at higher altitudes of the Pardubice region in particular 
Black ice may occur around Lanskroun Usti nad Orlici Policky Svitavy and Vysoke Myto and particularly on secondary and tertiary roads 
Snow is particularly affecting the roads in the Krkonose and Orlicke mountains 
At higher altitudes there is a compacted snow layer on the roads around Rychnov nad Kneznou and Trutnov 
In Eastern Bohemia the day will be mostly clear to partly cloudy and dry 
Temperatures will be between minus three and plus one degree Celsius mostly with a light wind 
Pilsen region
The roads in the Pilsen region have been usable this morning with extra care needed in some places Drivers should take the weather conditions into account 
The morning will be frosty with temperatures ranging between three and nine degrees below zero 
Due to the existing snow and subsequent drop in temperature certain roads may be icy 
Drivers should expect mist in places though visibility will gradually improve 
This information was reported by the regions highway service 
Most primary road surfaces are dry and frostfree 
Southern areas of the Pilsen and Tachov regions may have icy patches 
Secondary and tertiary roads are wet and may therefore also have icy patches 
Drivers should be cautious especially on less frequented roads in the Bohemian Forest 
Olomouc region
Drivers should expect snow slush on the roads if heading for the higher parts of the Olomouc region 
It is a result of the chemical treatment carried out at Cervenohorkse sedlo and on the way to Videlsky Kriz 
Snowploughs were brought out by falling snow overnight the Sumperk region according to highway maintenance got around three centimetres of snow 
In other parts of the region roads are mainly passable without restrictions 
Their Jesenik counterparts also made an outing overnight the roads all the way to the highest altitudes are now clear and wet following the chemical treatment according to them 
The Olomouc regions roads are usable without restriction while in the area of Sternberk drivers should beware in wooded areas where roads have remained wet 
Usti nad Labem region Liberec region
Since this morning the snowploughs have reported several places which are difficult to pass in northern Bohemia 
Besides certain snowcovered places or some icy frost patches the mountain road from Telnice to Kninice in the Usti nad Labem region is also closed according to the police database 
Temperatures remain below zero and roads are likely to remain snowy and icy In the lowlands however particularly southeast of the Central Bohemian Uplands there are no problems and roads are mostly dry 
No traffic holdups have so far been reported 
Icy frost patches have been reported in particular by road maintenance around Steti 
According to meteorologists the conditions for this were perfect rain and melting snow during the day with a clear night and freezing temperatures 
The closure of the Telnice to Kninice road was caused by bent tree branches which were weighed down to road level by snowfall 
Simon Ornest At the concerts we want a fusion of positive energy
What is your opinion on the end of the world that might come in less than a month 
It is just another startler which we like to latch on to 
Together with The Tap Tap band we tend to joke about it saying that we might be the only band on earth that could draw enough positive energy to hold off or avert the end of the world completely 
In December you are even organising a unique series of three concerts against the end of the world 
Can you give our readers some details on this 
This is a nationwide fundraising event which we have been planning for the past two years 
Who came up with this idea 
Initially it was probably my idea later we worked all the details out with our designer Honza Augusta 
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to stop the end of the world we also want to allow ourselves and the public to spare some thoughts for the state of our planet when we one day hand it over to our children 
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have also prepared a range of unique items shoes tshirts bags and original keys against the end of the world which can be purchased at wwwetapcz to support our cause 
It is already well received on YouTube will it figure at the fundraising concerts 
Of course for the grand finale as long as the world does not end beforehand 
It will be sung by all the artists at all the three concerts at the same time 
The anthem will also be featured in a unique live broadcast on Czech Television 
The words were written and the role of Jesus in the video clip was played by Tomas Hanak Xindl X also sings in it 
How did you end up working with them 
We collaborate also with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene due to organising a lot of fundraising events and concerts 
We try to really get them involved in these projects 
It turns out that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us 
What will the proceeds from the concert against the end of the world go to 
Equipping the wheelchairaccessible educational Studeo centre which is already in its sixth year in collaboration with the citizens association Tap from the Jedlicka Institute for the disabled 
Tutors come in regularly to spend time with the Jedlicka Institutes students and run activities which they enjoy and interest them 
The students themselves do not have the funds to afford tutors so we try to provide this for them in this way 
Within the construction project at the Jedlicka Institute a separate building is planned which we can move into with this project 
Every concert sees the appearance of several bands and artists 
How do you select them 
We have tried to compile a programme which speaks for all ages including children 
For example in Prague Chinaski Support Lesbiens Illustratosphere with Dan Barta The Tap Tap Marian Bango and Jiri Suchy will appear 
Further details can be found at wwwkpkscz
In May we will be making our first appearance in the Prague Spring so we will definitely be preparing a good lineup with some interesting guests 
Next year we would like to play at the Czech National House in New York and I personally since we will be in the USA would like to build in appearances in Washington and Chicago 
Your international plans are not modest you have already performed for instance in Madrid Brussels London and Moscow 
The Tap Tap is nonetheless a band composed of handicapped people 
How do you cope with these journeys in terms of logistics and organisation 
It is not as scary as it might seem at first 
We have five members in electric wheelchairs which must be transported in the luggage area we must also of course carry around with us a lot of luggage and instrument cases 
Nevertheless we have so far managed it without any problems CSA and British Airways were well prepared for us so much so that on occasion I was quite surprised 
Even in Moscow which we have just returned from it all went smoothly 
Thanks to these international trips you will have had a chance to compare specific accessibility issues public attitudes to disability and so on 
What have been your experiences so far 
After Madrid Luxembourg London and other places where everything functions better than here we have just witnessed that in the East everything is still in its beginnings 
Compared to Prague Moscow is rather inaccessible it still remains unusual there for a person in an electric wheelchair to be travelling around the city centre on his or her own 
Obvious things such as giving wheelchairs priority in lifts are not commonplace there 
Fortunately citizens associations are emerging there too that are trying to draw attention to the problems faced by people with disabilities 
And on the other hand where do we still lag behind more advanced countries 
There are a lot of things which we still lag behind on 
It is important to mention that improvements to the current situation always depend on the efforts of the people who are affected 
In London and Madrid it is completely natural for people with serious handicaps to be independently out in public and they can use the toilets go to the museum or wherever 
It is less common there for large groups of people with disabilities to actively take part in social life in this respect with The Tap Tap we are a step ahead 
Public respect or accessibility is one thing but it is only when we can become famous athletes artists actors politicians or lawyers that things will really begin to change 
So far there are only exceptional cases people who are strongwilled 
I began my job as a tutor at the Jedlicka Institute where I was surrounded by a lot of young people who were interested in doing something 
Since I am a musician myself among others I play the saxophone I started a music club with a colleague 
With time as our moderator Ladya Angelovic says it has grown a little out of our control laugh 
Your popularity has only come about in the last few years or am I mistaken 
It is true that we have been helped by creating ties to famous singers and also by our proactive work on promoting the band 
We realised that work which goes on unseen can be like it never existed 
Thanks to funds from the European Union we can even afford top quality tutors equipment and so on 
Was it your goal to take The Tap Tap to such heights 
From the outset I felt there was potential to do things a little differently 
Show business is filled with things where one imitates the other 
It is logical in its own way all new things are taken in hesitantly and take a long time 
Things which are unique are few and far between but I would dare to claim that Tap Tap is one of those things 
A persons first impression on seeing you is of course pity it is a natural reaction 
But that pity is simply wasted because handicapped people are not abandoned and suffering beings who need to be pitied 
They are people who can fully live life and blossom assuming of course that they have the right environment for it 
I say that when a person with a handicap succeeds in something it is not just progress for them but for society as a whole 
Has your success also been helped by your firm hand as a leader as many people are suggesting 
If we want to achieve top class work we must be uncompromising in many things and require a certain level of discipline 
I think this is to be expected 
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and their head in the clouds and when they find out they have to go to rehearsals twice a week attend practice sessions and put up with a lot of time travelling to concerts their enthusiasm quickly disappears 
That is how it works everywhere with every group that wants to work and wants to achieve something 
The Tap Tap band currently has twenty members 
Only one Ladya Angelovic 
We are an open group people come and people go this is unavoidable 
Those who have the interest and the drive will always find our door open 
Poland and the Cosmos 
Of course Polands path to the space had begun much earlier 
Polish boffins devoted their time to space flight even before the Second World War but were not always met with understanding 
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a series of books on these scientific subjects 
Gadomski became a worldknown promoter of astronautics and his contribution was notably recognised when a crater on the far side of the Moon was named after him 
Unfortunately both the projects designer and the projects details are unknown 
It is not even clear whether the rocket was intended to start the handcar or to slow it down 
Information about this rail track is only known from press articles of the time 
The research was undertaken by the Weapons Technology Division in collaboration with Prof Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof Gustaw Mokrzycki 
From the documents it is clear that the research reached the stage of practical tests 
Of course the advance of the German army interrupted the research 
Both projects were destined for military use of rocket engines 
Immediately prior to the War all projects for military use of rocket technologies were overseen by the Provisional Scientific Advisory Board Tymczasowy Komitet DoradczoNaukowy that coordinated all the work 
Further work devoted to astronautics appeared in the Polish Press after the War thanks to the Polish Astronautics Company Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne 
In one of these by Prof Subotowicz the establishment of a company is proposed which would dedicate itself to astronautics 
At the time there were already projects underway for artificial satellites and it was clear that cosmic research was an emerging sector 
Abolishing the legislation on public works is not the solution 
Last week the Constitutional Court abolished the law on public works 
The resolution caused lively public debate 
It will certainly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective 
Liberally oriented financial systems in the EU just as those in the globalised world are based on the principle of an unregulated economic competition 
Its effect means that individual financial entities and national economic systems are in a state of permanent conflict among themselves 
The cause is the principle of free trade and free completely unregulated movement of private capital together with uncontrolled financial speculation 
Due to significant labour cost differences salaries there is pressure on prices 
On a wider scale this means most businesses must move production abroad import cheaply from abroad or close down The result is high unemployment in countries where labour costs are high compared to other economies 
Since private capital is not bound by social responsibility and therefore also not by the unemployment it causes the social costs born by the state must necessarily increase 
The whole situation is bolstered by the businessmans complete unwillingness to pay taxes which would alleviate the economical and social harm caused in the pursuit of profit 
The situation is so well known that there is no need for actual statistical data 
The ruthless private capital practices create particular economic situations where the State in these countries is forced to enter in the mutual competition aiming to artificially lower the social standard of its own citizens in order to attract foreign investment 
In other words governments stake their own citizens because of private capital while disregarding the drop in social standards 
This occurs chiefly in amendments to existing law 
The aim is to economically force the domestic population to accept prices dictated by private capital especially in terms of salaries 
On one hand this economic system of force in case of longterm unemployment on the other restricted employee rights in the workplace 
This yields growing poverty and an increasing void between the poor and the rich 
In Germany there are already a host of food handout centres for the poor who are not able to feed themselves on their own wages 
The number of these people is already in the millions 
In the name of improving the competitiveness of the German economy it commonly occurs that properly employed people receive such a salary that the State needs to top it up to the minimum wage 
Just such a scandal was revealed in the case of auxiliary staff in the Bundestag 
At this point we have to ask where this may come from 
If it is to come from other EU states then poverty is being shifted from one country to another or it will not come at all because Chinese Indian Brazilian Turkish Moroccan Egyptian and African labour is still at a fraction of European wages 
This applies to all of Latin America 
Liberal theory and the Media incessantly claim that the State may not participate with capital in its own economy and that a controlled economy leads to economic ruin 
Private capital cruelly insists on the viewpoint that the State must not intervene in the economy 
Thereupon we should ask ourselves whether private capital has no influence or whether it actually leads politics and thereby the whole country for its own selfish ends 
Here the answer must be yes 
The proof is the existence of the almost omnipotent and in all states omnipresent lobby 
The result is a desperate situation manifesting itself through corruption through mutual benefits and legislation where almost everything is criminal but nothing is punishable 
In Germany the situation is such that state ministries through lack of financial resources contract out the drafting of laws to private law firms who are basically connected with industry 
These laws are then approved in the Bundestag 
Real power does not come from the people as the Westernstyle constitutions claim but from strong financial organisations that look after their own interests 
With bribery illegal acquisition of benefits and with stones or swords 
The conclusion just as in antiquity the current society is built on unscrupulous tendencies for personal gain without regard to the interests of society as a whole 
Private capital in its present state is not able to understand the interests of society as a whole 
The outcome is now as it was then an unprecedented decadence of the elite with no attempts whatsoever on deeper reaching reforms 
The current state of affairs when we consider the demise of those systems in favour of liberalised democracy as an interlude can expect its next cycle 
The particularly catastrophic reality is that the current elite is completely ignoring the potential lost of hundreds of thousands of lives humanitarian and social disasters which we are already witnessing as well as crimes against humanity as we are familiar with from ancient and modern history 
The abolition of the law on public works is not the answer at least not in the long term 
Under the pressure of economic competition internationally as well as within Europe the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to pursue ways of lowering the populations living standards 
This pattern is thus systemic 
To address this there are targeted political and social reforms which strengthen the states capital participation in the economy increase the peoples influence over the state and weaken the monopoly held by private capital over society in favour of the state 
Israel Chaos Lab 
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza strip as always has sparked a lot of reaction 
Some stand by Israel arguing it has the right to selfdefence and Palestinians are portrayed as terrorists while others support the Palestinians claiming racism by the Israeli state claiming that genocide is being committed against Palestinian Arabs and that Israel is a terrorist state 
I do not want to dwell in these repeated periodic waves of killing on who is the transgressor and who is the victim after all todays inhabitants of Israel including the selfgoverning territories were born into the current political situation and did not live through the start of the violence 
Some of my thoughts are supported by available historical facts while others are derived from my own understanding of who that is which group of people is the main source of events in modern history 
Human history is in the first instance about the struggle for power 
In every era we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon 
What is not quite so apparent is whether these were the people who had chosen their path independently or whether behind their throne stood someone who directed their actions towards a precalculated goal 
We must accept that we live in a time when the worlds wealth is concentrated into the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of wealth and the power it exudes could not happen in one generations lifespan 
Among these astronomically rich families one stands out which could be considered the puppet master whether someone else stands above them I am unsure but I would not rule it out the Rothschilds 
Not much is written about them 
Understandably 
Whoever attempted to defy this family died 
The method which the group of wealthy families with the Rothschilds leading the way employ is the instigation of crises followed by the offering of a solution order ab chao order from chaos 
Thus having succeeded in assassinating Ferdinand the Habsburg heir to the AustroHungarian throne in Sarajevo thereby unleashing World War I they destroyed tsarist Russia with the Bolshevik revolution 
The First World War ended abruptly militarily and economically unsubstantiated with German capitulation the war was no longer needed to destroy tsarist Russia and the central European powers of AustriaHungary were subsequently dismantled 
To facilitate the inception of the Second World War they allowed bankers and politicians to create a latent conflict situation by saddling Germany with huge war reparations thereby making a radicalist example of the impoverished masses it remained only to introduce a sufficiently convincing culprit and a leader with a simple solution while also creating a multiracial Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play and indeed did the role of a fifth colony once the war had been ignited 
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration formed the basis for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine where the first conflicts began with the local Arab population 
Terrorist attacks occurred on both sides 
World War II broke out and whether Hitler broke free from the leash which international bankers were holding him on or whether his actions were all part of the plan is difficult to determine nevertheless the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the foundation to the worlds acceptance of the Jewish State 
Provided the international bankers succeed the Jewish Nation as with the second will be the victims on the front line now together with the Arabic or more generally Muslim population of the Middle East 
Israel is like a huge laboratory a source of discord and chaos not only within the country but on an international level just look at how strongly people are split into supporters and opponents of Israel 
Who is the wrongdoer and who is the victim in the PalestineIsrael conflict where injustice breeds injustice in an endless cycle of violence while everything began from the greed of a few and their lust for global power 
Here we must differentiate between Israels general population and their leaders because just as it happens here the international bankers introduce their own selection of candidates for people to vote for 
The New World Order in their eyes is one of master and slave 
A world where the rest of the human population serve the luxury of a handful of financial aristocrats 
A world where each newborn is implanted with a chip which makes their existence completely subjugated 
If anyone has insight let him calculate the number of the beast 
Argo When things are at their worst call Hollywood 
They were to be released in exchange for the overthrown Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi who fled after the revolution to the USA which had actually supported his regime for several decades 
For the American administration the situation did not offer a positive solution it could not throw the Shah overboard because this would seriously jeopardise the trust of other allied countries 
The release of the hostages in Iran where the revolution resulted in the establishment of the theocratic regime could not be achieved 
This was a blow to the prestige of the United States which was later compounded by the fiasco of attempting to free the hostages by force 
Their ordeal provoked a wave of solidarity and antiIranian feelings at home 
The film Argo directed by the actor Ben Affleck recounts one episode in this story which brought America a small victory 
Just before the embassy was seized six employees escaped 
After some peripeteia they ended up in the Canadian ambassadors residence 
The CIA in collaboration with the Canadian authorities succeeded in getting them out of Iran helped by an extravagant cover story they left on Canadian passports as members of a film crew who were surveying locations for a scifi blockbuster 
A combination of genres
For the story to be believed the film project was reported on in specialist magazines press conferences were organised and the fictitious production company had a real office 
The details of the operation were for a long time kept secret the film draws on the memories of Tony Mendez 
Afflecks film is a peculiar mix of genres 
The mood alternates in the film on one side sharp documentarystyle sequences in Tehran the title sequence shows iconic photos from news of the time relating to the same events portrayed in the film there are no big differences 
On the other hand lighter sections from Hollywood laced with irony and a little exaggeration 
Then there are scenes from the CIA headquarters and other agencies men in suits debating the situation around meeting tables in office corridors over the phone 
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in extraordinary style 
The derided actor has become a respected director and his acting is no longer the target of ironic comments 
It is also Afflecks first picture which does not take place in the directors hometown of Boston 
The atmospheric feel in different locations is one of the characteristics which took his earlier films above Hollywood standards 
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets in the reconstruction of real events the opening sequence of the siege on the embassy is impressively lucid creating at once feelings of confusion and surprise which come flooding in as history suddenly takes a turn 
A similar effect is achieved by Affleck and his team in the fictitious scenes the fake staff at the Tehran bazaar 
Too much action in too many places
The director had to tackle the issue that the story being told does not offer many nailbiting scenes for the film 
What little there is is worked well with some occasional embellishments to reality these do not all come off so elegantly the scene where a looming crisis is averted at Tehran airport by a phone call in America followed by a chase on the runway seems quite farfetched 
Argos weakness is its divergence which comes from the need to show too many events in too many places 
Alan Arkin and John Goodman play their roles as the Hollywood assistants with great charm their characters deserve more room and are not by far the only ones in this film 
It does not really captivate 
As a reminder of historys particular ways and a testimony to how exaggerated the views are on the allpowerful allcontrolling secret services this will do 
Rules for blowing up balloons for bananas and a circus
Among the latest nominated absurdities for instance is the recent decision by the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women 
Until now women were favoured in life insurance prices because they constitute a lower risk for insurers 
Among the controversial EU regulations we might include the mandatory addition of bioingredients to fuel which consequently harms the environment the ban on reliable mercury thermometers just because they contain a relatively small quantity of a toxic substance or the rules on the size of chicken cages which significantly raised egg prices this year 
The Unions machine often makes decisions under pressure from this or that commercial or industrial lobbying group whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by state or group of states interests just as the Czech Republic is promoting the demands of its banks under threat of being vetoed 
The European Commission defended itself saying that it was only harmonising existing disjointed national standards which complicated trading 
Norms relating to fruit and vegetables have already been softened by the EU despite opposition from certain states referring to the food waste caused by the existing directives 
Here the EU pointed to an American research which indicated that among other toys balloons are one of the main causes of child suffocation 
Strange ideas are conceived at home too
Fairly absurd is the rule relating to individual European officials everyone in the EU who holds an official post may not use the term Macedonia due to it being a sensitive topic for Greece and instead the acronym FYROM Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be used 
The Bankovnipoplatkycom server in collaboration with the Liberal Economist Association Laissez Faire also nominated aside from the aforementioned absurdities for example the Unions regulation on the volume of food provision stocks held in an EU member state 
The EU stipulated the maximum volumes of food provisions which may be present within the CR on the day of our entry to the Union 
The Czech Republic thereafter exceeded for instance the permitted volume of mushroom preserves which incurred a high penalty 
The polls organisers were also impressed by the idea of paying certain countries because they do not have a coastline or the suggestion of allocating funding for a request for funding 
These ideas did not come from Brussels however but from Prague 
His argument was that there had been a good harvest of cereals and due to the socalled buyout interventions the states warehouses were full and were forced to export 
The Czech Republic is further away from a port so according to Palas the EU should be paying us hundreds of millions of Euros 
The European Commission finally met the CR halfway by organising a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea 
Funding to subsidise funding requests was offered to foreigners by the Ministry for Regional Developments minister Pavel Nemec USDEU specifically this was meant for making requests for funding from Brussels 
EU Bizarre legislation is the exception
Regulations may well become the target of criticism among member states but the EUs efforts at regulation more effective operation and development of the entire Union deserve recognition according to a number of experts 
A more important issue according to experts is the drawing of EU funds on projects which have hardly anything in common with strengthening the European integration but which was pushed through by member states during a budget meeting 
Emotions flare among Czechs when just as other countries in the Union the CR must fight in Brussels for the right to particular labelling on its traditional products in which it does not always succeed 
The appellation of rum can only be given to products distilled from cane sugar and not sugar beet 
Carlsbad wafers Pohorelicky and Trebonsky carp and Zatec hops have been added to the official list of registered products of the EU alongside the worldrenowned feta cheese and gorgonzola German marzipan from Lubeck and Parma ham 
The EUs stamp of protection can also be proudly shown on Pardubice gingerbread and Horicky tubes 
People want me to save the republic but I am an amateur says Okamura
Senator how does a person decide they want to run for President 
This is not about me being a senator or president 
If everything in our country worked without problems then I would not be running for any post 
I cannot watch any longer the country having been robbed over the past twenty years thieves roaming about there and peoples taxes and retirement age increasing 
I had no ambition to be a politician 
When I see something I do not like though I try to find a solution to change things 
Since I have already turned forty and I am an independent nonparty man I have no other choice to influence things but to stand for senator or president 
You have already reached the Senate but shortly after that you are taking off for the Castle 
Are you not turning your back on those who voted for you in doing this 
I have been saying the entire time that I would fight for the Castle based on the results in the Senates elections 
Later I added that if I were elected as senator I would be standing for president 
My goal though is not the post the post is a tool to allow my vision to be realised 
Therefore I need the greatest influence and the strongest mandate possible 
The trouble is not just that as a nation we swear in the pub or at the television but that we trample anyone who wants to try to change things 
The Media add to this misleading the public and mistaking freedom of speech with freedom to lie 
For example I was allegedly bribing reporters or I was allegedly an advisor of Jiri Paroubek 
Lets talk about your vision 
You set out on your castle siege with a thesis on the material and criminal responsibilities of politics and a retroactive financial disclosure of assets over twenty million 
You need to change the law for this 
As president though you do not have this power and only the Senate as a whole may propose laws 
How are you going to solve this 
When I lobbied as a citizen for tour guide work to be a free trade it was successfully carried through 
The problem is political squabbling when someone comes with a good idea from the left or the right it will be deliberately rejected causing delays for the public 
As an independent nonparty man I stand a far better chance of gaining support from all parliamentary sides 
The advantage I hold is that without the political pigeonholing or dogmas I can take what is best for our country from any side and apply it 
Do you see yourself as a person from the right or the left 
From the Czech viewpoint it seems they tend to put me to the left 
For me it just does not matter if it is a little to the left or right 
The important part for me is moving forward 
It is not about whether someone is from the left or right I just want to bring people together 
I always support any good public solutions even if they are put forward by the KSCM or the ODS and in the same way I will oppose bad ideas 
You get angry when someone calls you a populist 
Are you not confirming this with what you have stated 
When you make a company business plan you also have some ideal goal and vision 
You try to come close to it 
Some may call it populism but all the proposals I speak about are already working elsewhere or they have been put forward by experts 
But without the support of the Parliament you will be left with just slogans 
You will not last long in politics with that 
Or do you believe that if you walk among the public and talk with them that you will succeed say in passing criminal and material responsibility 
I have no alternative 
I need to convince politicians reporters and the public and try to get them on my side so we can put this through 
If I were elected president it would not be a problem to arrange a live television broadcast where I ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to pass a law on material and criminal responsibility for politicians civil servants judges and the Attorney General 
And as the case may be they would need to explain why they did not want this 
When there is a strong figure to point out the issues it just needs some pressure on the political scene 
Take for instance the direct election of the president it was achieved thanks to public pressure 
I will say frankly that I am an amateur I am not a genius or an intellectual 
I am looking for allies to share my opinions and vision 
I have just started out in politics and I am looking for a majority support for my agenda 
I will try to make things progress but it if does not work out in six years I will finish and return to the private sector 
It sounds a little like Okamura is trying to save the Czech Republic 
I am no saviour 
I know that alone I will not achieve anything so I have asked acquaintances whether they would run for the senate 
I went to Radim Jancura who declined due to his workload 
So I at least support investigative journalist Jana Lorencova who uncovered fraudulent activity with light heating oil 
I put myself forward because people are really discontented but now I have my doubts 
Sixty percent of people did not go to vote and those who did mostly voted for leaders of the establishment 
In the senate there are only two independents including me 
People have voted for a senate that will make it difficult to enforce changes 
Nonetheless I will fight for my vision for example for the direct election of mayors or regional council presidents 
Are you considering having your own party 
I have not considered it yet because I have neither the time to verify that every party member has a clean background nor the money to do it 
You have no money 
You are talking about financial disclosures but what is yours like 
I have the Aston Martin by the way because it was my dream as a boy I always liked James Bond who drove the car was gallant with women and also fought against evil and villainy 
You say you want to change the Republic but you are not keen on putting your own money into it 
This does not inspire much confidence 
Should I take out a loan 
The fact that I do not have any sponsors is evidence that there is no real interest in my programme 
I have no obligation to pay for my own campaign 
The expenditure on my campaign is basically covered by the pay I will be receiving as a senator 
If I were only interested in making money I would not be standing for election 
So you will still be in business so that you can make a living 
Did you not say you would be putting this on hold 
This depends on the rate of pay 
As I promised my activities have been partially reduced 
For example my deputy is taking over as the CEO of the travel agency in spring 
People would like me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic 
But I must also live off something 
As a businessman what would you usually make monthly 
And if I became president then I would end my business activity 
The full interview can be read in Saturdays issue of Pravo 
However I do wonder why people would need another library in this day and age 
Everyone has the Internet an iPad and eBooks 
Noone goes into one of these oldstyle libraries voluntarily nowadays or am I wrong 
Spijkenisse a sleepy town outside the gates of Rotterdam which barely merits a visit is a special recordholder 
In order to counteract this asinine situation the decision was made a number of years ago to make a contribution towards general education and to recreate the seven fictitious bridges that feature on the Euro notes as pretty painted reinforced concrete miniatures 
The success of the education offensive was limited 
And so the city fathers acknowledged that there was only one way to become master over the statistics a library had to be built 
So this is my suggestion for the Spijkenisse Book Mountain for the socalled Boekenberg 
Thus the faceless smalltown retort that until now had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian area and a stunningly ugly town hall behind whose white facades one would expect to find a dairy plant has been bolstered by a piece of contemporary architecture 
First and foremost however Spijkenisse now has its first public cultural building in the history of its existence 
The long journey to the book
The first impression the Eldorado of books beneath a cheese dome 
There is in fact a lift that climbs through the centre of the mountain massif however the true joys of space and literature are revealed when scaling the topography on foot 
The interior space glazed throughout is bright and open the fired clinker floors and the elegant street lamps speak the unmistakable language of a public town square 
The urban ambiance is perfect 
You are already on the lookout for a park bench a dog and boys and girls playing football 
And everywhere there are books books books 
We turned the classical spatial configuration on its head and turned the reading area inside out 
The interior of the Bcherberg is cleverly used in the centre there are offices an Internet library a chess club an environmental centre and the central technical support room 
One particularly special feature are the black book shelves which simultaneously act as wall cladding parapets and railings for the stairway 
The appearance feel and scent are foreign 
Even diehard architects and construction engineers shake their heads at the unknown construction materials 
And thus one day we stumbled across a suitable waste product used in agriculture on a Frisian farm 
For many years millimetrethick artificial fabric has been used in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands as a base layer 
It is inexpensive and saves time 
The thin textile lasts for two seasons and is then disposed of as bulk waste 
For the library the fabric was for the first time in these quantities pressed into fourcentimetrethick boards 
Under heat and pressure the socalled Landbouw plastic KLP changes colour to a dark homogeneous and robust material that smells like a mixture of new car smell and the smell of trainers 
These provide atmosphere but most importantly regulate the air humidity in the literary mountain range 
Donations for the new soul
It is heated and cooled using geothermal heat 
Although the Bcherberg has a glass cover the sun only shines only briefly into the interior even on sunny days 
The broad laminated wood glue beams positioned at rightangles to the glass facade provide shade and absorb the majority of the sunlight 
The indoor temperature is very pleasant 
The rest is taken care of by fully automatic roller blinds 
Stefan Spermon initially a sceptic of the IT sector has already ventured into the new library 
Lisette Verhaig has also visited already 
The reason At the inauguration just a few weeks ago every citizen was invited to donate a book from his her personal collection 
The concept has been a success 
The shelves are full to capacity 
Everyone knows that their book is part of the building 
Even if its just for decoration 
As such MVRDV have succeeded in mastering the master discipline that specialist jargon refers to as the formation of identity 
Spijkenisse has written literary history 
However young and uneducated it may be 
This is ultimately a starting point for identity 
In the vote on the incorporation of Palestine Germany abstained from voting 
According to Stephen Szabo Expert in USEuropean relations in so doing Berlin is walking a thin diplomatic line 
Deutsche Welle At the beginning of the week Germany had initially signalled that it would vote against the Palestinians application for observer status within the United Nations 
However Berlin subsequently abstained from voting 
Why 
Stephen Szabo Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza 
Now however due to their special relationship with Israel Germany must be cautious 
At the same time however I do not believe that it supports the American position either 
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence albeit without being too critical of Israel 
This was ultimately implemented by NATO 
Does Germany find it difficult to adopt a clear position when it comes to important international affairs 
Yes it does 
That is because it has just reorganised its foreign policy indeed moving away from a policy that was so to speak managed by the USA in favour of a German foreign policy 
This situation is aggravated by the fact that the Europeans do not have a coherent and standardised policy 
The Germans thus find themselves caught between two fronts 
It is expected of them that they play a more independent role yet this is something that they are not accustomed to 
A foreign policy similar to that of France or Great Britain 
It shows a willingness to adopt positions on international matters which are independent of those of the USA or European partners 
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy that is by export and its relations with certain regions such as Russia China or the Near East 
Germanys economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests 
Have these economic interests had an influence on their attitude towards the Near East conflict and their voting in the UN 
On the one hand Germany has major revenue markets in the Near East and particularly in the Gulf States 
Therefore it must be careful not to affront the public but also the elite in the Arabic countries 
In any case this plays a role 
However I wouldnt want to ascribe too much weight to this This is not an entirely onesided relationship 
Nonetheless it does play an important role in Germanys considerations 
Has Germany damaged its relations with the USA by abstaining to vote on important decisions such as the vote on Palestine 
I think that in Europe and even in the USA a great understanding for the German position prevails 
Therefore I do not think that this was as dramatic a fracture as was the case in the matters regarding Libya 
Perhaps it will even earn Germany a certain degree of respect 
After all it signals that the country must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be considered 
In Europe there are diverse opinions regarding the Palestinian initiative 
The USA on the other hand have spoken out clearly in favour of a veto 
Are there differences of opinion between the USA and the many European nations 
Due to the American domestic policy these differences have always existed 
I think that secretly the government under Obama actually has a great deal of understanding for the European situation 
However due to the political situation here the government is naturally unable to voice this position publicly 
It is my belief that the actual differences in opinion are not so vast as they always appear 
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanjahu Obama is really not quite so enthused by Netanjahus policies 
Does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the USA on the one hand and the position of its most important partners in the EU on the other 
I think that this is precisely what makes things so difficult for the Germans 
It would of course be a little simpler for the Germans if there were a coherent and standardised European policy which is currently not the case 
Thus they are unable to be part of a wider authority and must instead drive matters forward from their own position 
This is precisely what they are doing with the Euro 
I believe that in the future Germany will take on a leading role in urging Europe towards a standardised European position 
This is of course no simple task for Germany on account of its relations with Israel 
This has always been a sensitive subject 
Yet I do think that Germans are clear that they must play a more independent role 
Does Germany view itself as playing the role of an important international player does Germany actually want to assume a leading role 
Or does Germany still find leadership roles difficult 
Germany is still not used to it the country continues to be uncomfortable and for obvious reasons still finds it difficult to play a more prominent role 
If we look at the Euro crisis for example every time that Germany assumes a more prominent role various antiGerman feelings become apparent 
This does not make matters simple for the Germans 
This is actually the same old problem one does not want to be surrounded by hostile countries 
From this stance Germany is in a much more difficult position than the USA 
It must be receptive to the most diverse of neighbours and opinions and this is not easy 
The influence of the USA over European politics is continually diminishing yet the EU is currently not feeling this vacuum so who is filling the gap 
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role 
Even if they do not like it even if it is uncomfortable and makes them even more unpopular cest la vie

Armani is a worldfamous brand Polo Ralph Lauren likewise 
However what is Armani Polo 
Behind this name hides a fully officially registered brand in China however one that has nothing whatsoever to do with the original companies 
Nonetheless it is enjoying protection provided the actual creators of the names do not sue 
And even then it is not clear whether they will have any rights 
Every week a new case lands on my desk 
All the copycats require are a few additional letters in order that they can register their brands 
Thus Gucci simply becomes LuGucci PradaKny is registered in place of Prada 
German companies are also legally copied in this manner such as manufacturer of sporting apparel Puma 
Pattloch opens a file containing registrations with the trademark office in Peking 
The fact that the Chinese are world champions in copying and infringing on intellectual property is wellknown 
In the major cities there are multilevel department stores that sell counterfeit goods almost exclusively 
Pattlochs cases however are slightly different on behalf of his clients he takes action against the fact that Chinese companies can be granted the right to use a name by the trademark office fully officially which is already protected elsewhere 
This refers to women who latch onto rich men 
The Chinese authorities are unaware of any wrongdoing 
The financial losses and process costs of the affected branches amount into the millions especially in the case of expensive flagship products 
However the deletion of dubious entries in the trademark registry are difficult to achieve and cost a pretty penny 
The process can last for up to nine years with an uncertain outcome 
If the complainant is unlucky he may even have to pay the plagiarist money for having infringed on his trademark in China said Pattloch 
Sometimes the law of the jungle prevails here 
Famous cases also relate to graphic elements 
Even today the Chinese company is therefore permitted to use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star 
Volvopurchaser Geely originally used a blue and white logo that resembled the BMW logo the dispute was arbitrated and Geely was forced to change it 
Fashion house Lacoste lost a suit in China against copycats from Hong Kong and Singapore who were using the famous crocodile looking in the other direction 
The Chinese authorities are unaware of any wrongdoing 
To remedy this is very expensive
As is so often the case in China the figures are imposing 
This is a record and means that China for the tenth time in succession is the global leader when it comes to new trademark applications informed the authority 
To appeal against an application costs many times this amount as can be seen in the case of the German family business Freudenberg 
For more than seven years the group has been contesting against a Chinese plagiarist 
The Germans did in fact manage to expose the companys illegal manufacturing of copied motor vehicle parts 
However the copycat still secured the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand 
This is something we missed ourselves as family names cannot be protected in Germany said Hanno Wentzler Chairman of the Board of Management at Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich 
The CTMO trademark office then also dismissed the Munichbased companys appeal 
In the next two instances Freudenberg was proven right however the opposing party continues to contest the matter to this day 
You have to pay extremely careful attention 
The matter is now pending before the Supreme Court 
Wentzler is confident that the matter will be brought to a positive conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts 
The internal costs can barely be calculated the company archive even had to look through centuryold records in order to provide proof 
The dangers in the Far East even threaten to spilling over back into Europe 
Particularly if imitators secure unprotected brand names there 
For example a Chinese manufacturer wanted to register the Freudenberg label for shoes and leather in Germany 
This is a business sector that the group had long vacated yet nonetheless managed to prevent the registration 
Both he and Pattloch advise companies to be very careful when conducting business with China 
Otherwise costs can be much more expensive than the registration fee 
In actual fact if Freudenberg were to loose at the final hurdle of its trademark drama they would probably have to pay the opposing party license fees for the use of their own name explained Wentzler 
Or alternatively we would be forced out of the market in the respective sector 
World AIDS day Stomp sing help
In Heidelberg the Imbongi choir is rehearsing and in the Swaziland AIDS orphans are delighted 
First of all the stamping cowboy boots basketball shoes ladies pumps and mens loafers attempt to find the beat on the parquet floor and quickly do just that 
Onetwothreefour 
Only then do the voices of the singers slowly swell alto bass tenor and soprano surge beguile and haunt 
It is Monday evening and in the music room of the Institute for Medical Psychology in Heidelberg the Imbongi Choir are practising a new song 
Helping others to help themselves
This guarantees the child money for school a school uniform and a warm meal each day in the Gogo Centre 
In Zulu Imbongi means storyteller or worshipper 
In this region noone can speak the Bantu language fluently but they can sing it 
For almost ten years the choir has been practising songs in this foreign soft language and now and then they bring them back to where they originally came from the South of Africa 
Forty percent are infected 
In Esitjeni you get a small foreshadow of the illness from which all of Swaziland is suffering according to Unicef the region has the highest HIV infection rates and the lowest life expectancy in the world 
Circumcision which has been proven to reduce the risk of contracting the virus by half is barely practised by the population 
More than forty percent of people in the Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus and dying in you midthirties is by no means rare 
Without a school leaving certificate there are barely any opportunities particularly in a poor country 
Initially it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school and enable him her to have one warm meal a day for a few euros per year 
Facts on sexually transmitted infections 
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases 
Bacterial STIs include syphilis chlamydia and gonorrhoea 
Common viral STIs are HIV human papilloma viruses herpes genitalis and hepatitis 
Crabs and scabies belong among the parasitic STIs 
Who are the main affected groups 
Syphilis and gonorrhoea occur primarily in men that have intercourse with other men 
The Robert Koch Institute understands that at least four in five of all syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted by means of sexual contact between men 
Among heterosexual adults chlamydia infections trichomoniasis candidiasis fungal gonorrhoea and human papilloma viruses are frequently occurring sexually transmitted diseases 
Among young people chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups 
In this country human papilloma viruses are also frequently found in young people 
How has the number of infections developed 
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are notifiable 
This is around one tenth fewer than the previous year 
Which symptoms indicate a sexually transmitted disease 
The infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area discomfort when urinating discharge lower abdominal pain and blisters or warts 
However often they cause no pain or any other symptoms thus remaining undetected 
How can you protect yourself 
This is because occasionally the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on via smear infections and close bodily contact 
Therefore first and foremost experts recommend that people with frequently changing sexual partners undergo regular examinations 
If diagnosed early the majority of STIs can be cured and longterm consequences avoided 
Through sponsorships donations and by no means least the funds that the choir raises across the whole of Germany the money all adds up 
In the village itself Zodwa Dlamini a selfassured and assertive woman manages the money from Germany 
She makes sure that the orphans have good accommodation for example with one of their grandmothers 
The Gogos as the old ladies are called in Zulu are the pillars of the village 
This is nothing to be taken for granted as is clearly the attitude towards illness throughout the entire country the best way of keeping things under wraps is if people are dead 
The last absolute monarch of subSaharan Africa King Mswati III is known for his excessive lifestyle 
Polygamy in place of democracy 
Among other factors the fact that the HIV virus has spread quickly over the past number of decades can also be attributed to this officially sanctioned lifestyle 
Another factor is the large number of migrant workers who carry the virus across the country 
In order to promote the cultural exchange the Imbongi choir travels through Southern Africa every two or three years and sings songs of melancholy fighting spirit confidence and black selfesteem which many from the southern tip of the black continent still know from the times of apartheid 
A bus full of white people who sing songs in a black language this degree of recognition brings not only morale and joy but some grimfaced border soldiers even shed a few tears 
The journey always leads to Esitjeni where the singers visit their sponsor children 
Even though you can barely find the small village on a map it is more than wellknown in the valley of the Ezulweni River 
Messenger NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of ice on the planet Mercury 
The US space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury 
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the region of the planet that lies permanently in shadow 
The water presumably came from comets or perhaps also asteroids that impacted with Mercury 
However noone is linking the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet said Chief Scientist for the Messenger probe Sean Solomon 
That said the findings could help explain how water and other building blocks of life reached other regions of the solar system 
Unknown to the majority of the Earths inhabitants there are probes telescopes and small robots such as the Phoenix deployed to research the depths of the universe 
From time to time they transmit images to Earth small peepholes into the infinite expanse 
This image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute 
The eight planets of our solar system plus the dwarf planet Ceres 
This shimmering glow of a dying star was captured by NASAs Spitzer telescope 
The donutshaped ring consists of material ejected by the star in the process of dying 
NASAs Spitzer telescope shot this photo of the galactic delivery room 
With the telescope however the colours really come into their own 
In this infrared photo the Helix Nebula looks back at the observer like a red eye 
Its similarity with the continent resulted in this Nebula acquiring the title North America 
A combination of normal and infrared photography produced the spectacular colouring 
This baby star could only be captured in its full beauty using the Spitzer telescopes infrared detectors 
Saturn and its rings How these occurred is the greatest puzzle in the field of astronomy 
One of the largest and sharpest pictures from the Hubble telescope the Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the colouring photographs of spiral galaxies can become genuine works of art 
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula in the Sagittarius constellation several thousand light years away 
The name Trifid stems from the Latin word trifidus divided into three parts as dark stripes of dust divide the core of the birthplace of stars into three parts 
Anyone who doesnt like technical abbreviations may prefer to call it by its nickname the Southern Catherine Wheel 
The photo taken by the Hubble space telescope shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the Cepheus constellation 
This image was put together from the Xray images captured by various telescopes 
This star nebula is home to the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way 
This star cradle continually produces new youngsters 
In this bright shining galaxy with one small black hole there exists no dust only gas 
Researchers presume that it only came into being shortly after the Big Bang when the universe was comprised primarily of hydrogen 
Our view of the universe the most important telescopes
Since then the mirrors in optical telescopes have become increasingly large and the insights that they provide increasingly profound 
The mirror shown in the image had a diameter of five metres 
Arizona USA is home to the Large Binocular Telescope 
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to reduce costs 
In spite of this it achieves a diameter of around eleven metres 
The disadvantage of this inexpensive construction method the telescope is securely clamped at its angle of inclination and its movement is therefore limited 
The Hobby Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed angle of inclination 
What sets it apart the high lightgathering capacity 
This in spite of its comparatively low mirror diameter even matches that of the worlds largest reflector telescopes 
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo Puerto Rico researchers can listen for extraterrestrial signals in space 
View of the European Southern Observatory ESO in the Chilean Andes 
This is home to the Very Large Telescope which lives up to its name 
With its total of four mirrors the telescope can also focus on the medial infrared spectrum 
Likewise to be located at the ESO Observatory in Chile the European Extremely Large Telescope is also being planned 
They each have two mirrors each with a diameter of ten meters 
The Keck Telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory which alongside the Keck telescopes can look to the heavens with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF 
Another huge new telescope is also to be built on the Mauna Kea with a mirror diameter of thirty metres 
Here you can marvel at an artists impression 
However the most important insights into space are provided by the Hubble space telescope 
The image documents the final launch preparations on the Kepler space telescope 
One of the telescopes tasks is to search for light from the first stars and galaxies that emerged after the Big Bang 
Scientists are assuming that ice also exists at Mercurys south pole 
However there is no reliable data in support of this as the Messenger orbits around the planets much closer to the north pole 
For decades radar measurements have indicated that there is ice on Mercury 
In Southern Azerbaijan many people reach biblical ages 
There is even a museum of longevity 
In Southern Azerbaijan many people reach ages that can almost be considered biblical 
There is even a museum of longevity 
The journey through the Talysh Mountains can be described as wild and romantic 
The minibus rumbles over the winding streets past densely wooded hills raging rivers and simple farmhouses 
Everywhere is green and lush you could be forgiven for thinking you were in the Black Forest 
However this is the deep south of Azerbaijan and the border with Iran is just a few kilometres away 
This is the home of the Caucasian people group the Talysh of whom not much is known except that they speak perfect Persian and Azeri and live long lives 
The final stop is Lerik 
The small town is bursting with overpowering architecture from Soviet times which doesnt fit with the picturesque mountain landscape at all 
Tourists from Europe rarely come here the journey from Azerbaijans capital city Baku is too arduous 
The fabulous wealth for which the country has its oil in the Caspian Sea to thank has not yet arrives here in the province 
She is the Director of the Museum of Longevity most likely the only of its kind in the world 
However no birth certificate exists to confirm this 
So did Shirali Muslimov miscalculate his age by a couple of decades 
But Rembrandt Scholz researcher on ageing at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock has also heard of people living to impressive ages in Central Asia 
Due to lacking documentation however there is no scientific proof of age particularly as there are no birth registers 
Melted butter by the glass every day
However the fact remains that the people of the region surrounding Lerik reach a biblical age with striking regularity 
So why do so many very old people live here in the south 
The Azeri travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this as being due to the special Talysh genetics 
In contrast Museum Director Fatulayeva believes that it is due to diet 
However the notion that the calorierich diet of the Talysh who love meat bread and especially dairy products and of whom many drink a glass of melted butter on a daily basis could be considered healthy from a nutrition science perspective does not really seem plausible either 
Or is it the traditional way of life that keeps the people young In Cengemiran a tiny settlement not far from the town of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva 
She sits on the floor with a butter churn which she rolls backwards and forwards tirelessly 
Eight people live here under this roof including one of Mirzayevas sons and a daughter both of whom have been grandparents for some time 
There are also two small children running around 
In the kitchen tea is prepared for the guests which is served in typical bulging Armadu glasses 
Mirzayevas white teeth stand in perfect rank and file beneath her headscarf she conceals long dark blond plaits which her son proudly reveals for us 
I have always washed my hair with milk and it has never fallen out or lost its colour 
Monthly pension is enough to live on
She has only ever eaten what she could get from her own farm tomatoes potatoes peas 
My whole life I have never once bought groceries in the supermarket 
Then she tells of her husband who was in the army 
Things were at their worst during the time after the Second World War 
The propaganda seems strange coming from the mouth of an old lady 
Yet the cult that revolved around the father figure for the nation who governed his country like a dictator practically knows no limits in Azerbaijan 
At least there is no deprivation among Azerbaijans elderly 
They live among their extended family are loved cared for and are happy 
If this is not a reason to live for as long as possible then what is 
The revolution has returned to Cairo 
Competing demonstrations in Cairo reveal the deep division within the country 
The future constitution based on Sharia law is fiercely disputed 
The Egyptian President is not holding back his emotion 
We must make the transition 
His speech was aimed at the entire population however in particular at the Coptic Christians the liberals enlightened Muslims and secularists 
For all of them until now hopelessly estranged in a bewildered opposition are fearful 
They are fearful of a God State on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood 
Should the judiciary be deprived of power 
This was and remains subject to interpretation and there is concern that the Islamists will make use of the woolly formulation and the resulting room for legal manoeuvre in favour of a stricter interpretation of Sharia law 
This is at least suggested by one newly added article in all issues affecting Sharia law the Al Ashar University must be consulted the countrys most important Islamic institution which has great influence throughout the whole of Sunni Islam 
This can but does not necessarily have to mean that the clergy will oversee legislation which would result in the de facto incapacitation of the judiciary 
Much in the constitutional draft is open to interpretation
Also problematic civil military jurisdiction will continue to be upheld 
During Mubaraks rule these courts served to suppress opposition 
From a legal perspective this is formulated in such an unclear manner that state institutions could even use this article to control the content of cinematic art and literature 
In plain language this is nothing other than censorship 
Incidentally no article explicitly establishes the equality of men and women 
Another does prohibit the insult or slander of the prophet Mohamed and his emissaries 
However what constitutes an insult and how this should be sanctioned remains unclear 
Is a caricature of the president sufficient or a joke at the expense of a jurist 
For weeks the opposition has been gathering to combat the superior strength of the Islamists 
Tens of thousands gathered on Friday evening at the Tahrir Square in Cairo in unfamiliar unity and pledged to bring down the charter before it has even come into effect 
And several judges have signalled that they do not want to oversee the referendum which would render it invalid 
The wellorganised Muslim Brotherhood gathered for a counterdemonstration although acting cautiously they did not choose the Tahrir Square but rather a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile outside the Cairo University 
A struggle for control over the symbolic Tahrir Square where everything began would have most likely provoked events verging on civil war 
Quite clearly this was something that Mursis followers did not want to risk 
The Muslim Brothers stated that both those against and those in favour of the constitutional draft had expressed themselves loud and clear 
Now is the time to let the population decide at the ballot box in which direction the country should move forward 
It is a certainty that there is a majority in favour of the Islamists draft 
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious about this forced constitutive process which actually should have lasted until February and should have involved all social interest groups 
Not because he shared their world view but because for him human rights are indivisible 
For this he was battered condemned and imprisoned 
The lawyer has resigned himself to Mursi extending his power to all three branches of state government 
These measures are blatant breaches of the ground rules of democracy and will guide Egypt into a new dictatorship 
Yet without civil society organisations a democracy cannot function 
Saeda feels abandoned even by the international community which is observing the battle over the ideological direction on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and excitement 
This could come back to haunt them 
Norways rakfisk Is this the worlds smelliest fish 
Norways five million people enjoy one of the highest standards of living not just in Europe but in the world 
Could the secret of the countrys success be connected to the local appetite for some exceedingly smelly fish 
Take a selection of overripe cheeses 
Place them in the midst of a pile of dirty wet soccer kit 
Leave for a week 
Now you have the nosenumbing smell of rakfisk one of the great Norwegian delicacies 
I am in the small town of Fagernes about three hours from Oslo 
There is snow spectacular scenery and that odour ever present hangs in the air 
Rakfisk is trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in water for depending on how smelly you like your fish up to a year 
As the dark sets in and the weather turns cold Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes devoted to this most well captivating of foods 
All around us people are eating little cubes of the fish and knocking back quantities of drink 
The drink can kill the smell 
I try a few pieces 
If you can avoid passing it under your nose it is not bad not unlike a slice of sushi that has been on rather a long bus journey 
Rakfisk is a product of very different povertystricken times in Norway when prerefrigeration fish was soaked in airtight barrels of water and salt in autumn 
Then in the depths of winter well and truly fermented it is taken out and no doubt with the senses knocked out by alcohol eaten 
Only a generation ago thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work emigrating mainly to the US 
People from Sweden the old rival and not so long ago far richer than Norway stream in to work 
Rakfisk is seen as signifying something important a vital if rather smelly part of Norways past 
It is among the more expensive dishes you can buy 
Norway does not often make it on to the global news agenda and most seem to like it that way 
Norwegians find it very difficult to believe that in their peaceloving country one of their own was capable of such brutality and murder 
We are a how you say prudent people 
Her English like that of most people here is flawless 
We are not very showy we do not like ostentation 
Norway has handled its oil wealth very carefully all but a small percentage of money from the industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations 
When everyone else was throwing around money they did not have in the years leading up to the global financial crash Norway kept its purse strings tightly bound 
I stand in the snow and queue for something to eat I have had enough rakfisk 
Now an elk burger is certainly something different and rather succulent to the taste 
But in the evening it is more of that smelly fish 
The hotel I am staying in is one of a number of venues hosting a rakfisk dinner where guests vote on the best or perhaps the most nasally challenging fish 
There is a live TV link up to a compere in a bow tie surrounded by plates of rakfisk 
It is like the Eurovision song contest 
There is clapping laughter 
A man falls off his chair perhaps overcome with aquavit 
Or maybe it is the fumes from all that fish 
Mexicos Enrique Pena Nieto faces tough start
As Mexicos incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office the BBCs Will Grant looks at the challenges facing him and the mixed expectations of his population 
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at present 
A congested city at the best of times a ring of steel has been erected since Monday cutting off several key routes into the capital and causing chaos on the roads 
The aim however wasnt to stop commuters getting to work but prevent protesters from reaching parliament 
On Saturday Mexicos new president Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidential sash and take over the running of the nation 
He faces a complicated task 
I will be proposing a new security strategy which will allow us to achieve that aim 
Before rubbing shoulders with the US president Mr Pena Nietos previous political experience was as governor of his home state the State of Mexico 
A populous sprawling state surrounding the capital opinions about the new leader are divided in his old stomping ground 
A straightforward man
In the bucolic town of Valle del Bravo for example he is remembered fondly 
Residents credit him with boosting tourism in the resort and building infrastructure 
To reach the town you can drive along one of Mr Pena Nietos new motorways a vast improvement on the cracked and bumpy roads it replaced 
Plaques bearing his name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum about climate change 
Particularly in terms of security and the economy were hoping for an interesting and true change which our country so badly needs 
And he rejects the oppositions characterisation of the new president as lacking substance 
Hes a very straightforward man very committed with an excellent vision of the country 
Hes an excellent statesman and above all hes someone who knows how to listen 
But on the other side of the state that is not the impression many people have of their former governor 
In Nezahualcoyotl also known as Ciudad Neza the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo couldnt be sharper 
Tucked away under motorway flyovers it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself 
And the problems in the municipality are also gritty and urban 
Earlier this year the military was called in to help tackle the drug gangs operating in the neighbourhoods and violence against women is particularly acute 
On a patch of wasteland by a vast landfill site the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been dumped over the past two years alone 
Mr Pena Nietos critics say at best he failed to adequately address the problem of femicide while he was in office 
At worst they accuse his administration of turning a blind eye 
In a concrete home typical of the rundown neighbourhood Irinea Buendia struggles to fight back the tears as she shows me photos of her late daughter Mariana Luna 
However her family believes she was murdered by her partner 
There were signs shed been beaten and rigor mortis had already set in 
As her mother recounts the story a picture of Mariana looks down from the walls next to a cross bearing a single word Justice 
However that is exactly what the family say they have been denied 
The state authorities have treated me like Im an old gossip a troublemaker a whiner 
What they want is that one simply accepts what they say and shuts up 
As President Pena Nieto receives the sash on Saturday it comes with a heavy responsibility 
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to make them a priority during his time in office 
That however is exactly what victims families in Ciudad Neza most fear 
Bradley Manning didnt complain about mistreatment prosecutors contend
Prosecutors try to counter Bradley Mannings claims of abuse in confinement
The hearing focuses on Mannings time in the military brig at Quantico Virginia
Defense wants case dismissed on grounds that Mannings confinement was harsh
The Army private is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents
Prosecutors tried to establish Friday that Army private Bradley Manning charged in the largest leak of classified material in US history missed multiple opportunities to complain about the mistreatment hes alleging he suffered in military custody 
While crossexamining Manning at a pretrial hearing at Ft Meade Maryland prosecutor Maj Ashden Fein asserted that records of weekly visits Manning had with unit officers during nine months of detention at Quantico Virginia show no complaints about his treatment 
The crossexamination during a hearing on a defense motion to have Mannings case dismissed on grounds that his confinement has been harsh and has amounted to enough punishment came a day after Manning testified that he had considered suicide while in custody 
The material was then published online by WikiLeaks 
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of its information 
Officers would ask Manning questions and write down his responses 
The forms show no complaints of mistreatment even though the officers asked Manning directly about his treatment Fein contended 
Manning responded that he would verbally express concern about issues and that the visiting officers would talk through the concerns and indicate that they would be addressed but they didnt record the issues 
The military said they put him on this restrictive status a step below suicide watch for his protection and the safety of others 
He said he contemplated suicide in Kuwait and once passed out there due to the heat 
He said not being allowed to know what was happening to him or in the outside world was distressing 
I thought I was going to die in that cage 
Manning said he was allowed only a mattress blanket flipflops some clothes and his glasses 
He said he tried to keep moving because sleeping during the day or even lying down was against the rules 
Manning said he always slept with light from outside his cell in his eyes 
If guards could not see his face when he rolled over at night he said they would wake him to roll back over 
Also Friday the judge asked Manning about an allegation that he made in Thursdays testimony that after being forced to sleep naked one night in his Quantico cell he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates during a morning head count 
Manning had testified that he was never given a chance to cover himself with his blanket during the head count 
Under questioning from the judge Friday Manning said that he inferred from his guards order that he should drop a blanket that could have covered him but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it 
Manning testified Thursday that he was forced to sleep naked the previous night because of his attempt to show an officer that he wasnt a danger to himself 
Manning said that he told the officer that he could have used the waistband of his underwear or his flipflops to hurt himself but hadnt done so 
That night Manning testified his underwear flipflops and glasses were removed from his cell 
His lawyers hope the judge will at least take his experiences during confinement into account and sharply reduce his sentence should he be convicted at his courtmartial which is expected to begin early next year 
The defense has said it plans to have Manning plead guilty to lesser offenses and fight other charges as being too extreme 
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend with prosecutors expected to argue that the detention conditions were warranted 
The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was held in accordance with rules governing all maximumcustody detainees at Quantico 
Counts against Manning include aiding the enemy wrongfully causing intelligence to be published on the Internet transmitting national defense information and theft of public property or records 
If hes convicted on all counts he could face a life sentence 
My MexicanAmerican identity crisis
He says many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities there
Mexicans tend to fault those who left they remind Mexicans of hard times he says
Navarrette says MexicanAmericans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City I had barely made my way down the concourse and arrived at the immigration processing area when I got stumped 
I stood there for a few seconds unsure of where to go 
But this was Mexico 
And in the homeland of my grandfather there was no need for shorthand or hyphens 
I was simply an American 
I speak Spanish good enough to handle either end of an interview in that language 
But I dont have the vocabulary of a native and I cant shake my American accent 
So I took my US passport and got in the line for Extranjeros 
I thought about that moment this week when Mexican presidentelect Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama 
On the agenda as usual when the leaders of these two countries meet immigration drugs and trade 
Pena Nieto was also eager to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy which is one reason that Mexicans are now just as likely to stay in Mexico as venture to the United States 
He wants to partner with the United States and Canada and create a European Unionstyle trading bloc in North America 
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue Mexicos war against the drug cartels even though he offered no specifics 
For Mexico the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with hard feelings 
But for Mexicans who think in terms of centuries not minutes the reminders are everywhere 
So the minute that a US official says anything the least bit critical of Mexico you start hearing in the Mexican press and among the elites complaints about how the Americans are encroaching upon their neighbors sovereignty 
And the children of Montezuma go on the warpath 
You want to talk about hard feelings 
There is plenty 
Mexico has winners and losers people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it doesnt 
The only reason you have so many people of Mexican ancestry living in cities like Los Angeles Las Vegas Phoenix Denver or San Antonio is because at some point in our family tree there was a person maybe a parent or grandparent who was shut out from opportunity in Mexico and had to go north 
And more often than not that person fit a profile dark skin little education from a poor village etc 
Were their offspring and were loyal to them 
Not Mexico 
And even though we may now be living the American Dream having gone to good schools and taken good jobs we can never lose sight of the fact that its the American Dream were living and not the Mexican one 
Our identity might sometimes be fuzzy but our loyalty is clear 
Its to the United States 
Besides were aware that many of the elite Mexicans in the ruling class dont like us 
The feeling is mutual 
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look down on us as inferior stock that isnt sufficiently Mexican 
Our Spanish will never be good enough our ties to Mexico never strong enough 
Our existence is as they see it all about failure 
If our families hadnt failed in Mexico they wouldnt have left 
And we wouldnt now find ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain living well in the United States but lost souls nonetheless 
My wife who was born in Guadalajara and came to the United States legally as a child reminds me that there is friction between Mexicans and MexicanAmericans because Mexicans have a firmer grasp of who they are and MexicanAmericans resent that 
While shes a US citizen she sees herself as a part of two countries 
Meanwhile many MexicanAmericans I know dont feel like theyre a part of either 
We love listening to the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte but also to Bruce Springsteen 
You get the best of both worlds but youre rooted in neither 
In Mexico were seen as Americans 
And in the United States were considered Mexican 
Now to complicate the relationship even further as I learned during my trip some Mexican leaders and parts of the intelligentsia want to reconnect with the Diaspora 
We would tell our fellow Americans what a great country this is to visit and pressure political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico 
Yeah 
Thats not going to happen 
Too many hard feelings 
And with income inequality and rampant corruption and drug violence many of us are not so sure that it is a great country 
Im afraid youre on your own amigos 
Thats fair 
If at least some Mexicans arent yet ready to forgive the United States for how it treated Mexico a century and a half ago then they have to accept the fact that some MexicanAmericans still hold a grudge for how their family members were treated much more recently than that 
Hmmm 
Old battles new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could yet be an unlikely foundation for peace
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East 
Another round of bloodshed suggests that any such hope is vain 
But though the Israelis and Palestinians seem stuck in their ancient conflict all around them the Middle East is changing 
The Arab spring has thrown the pieces up in the air and like it or not the Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in the regional turmoil 
Maybe this will make their struggle bloodier than before 
However there are reasons for thinking it could just break their lethal stalemate 
A war that is neither lost or won
At first sight optimism looks very hard to justify now 
Indeed Hamas is gaining on the West Bank the other bit of Palestine currently run by its bitter rivals in Fatah the more moderate Palestinian faction 
Moreover Hamass leaders may well conclude that time is on their side 
As Islamists across the Arab world have gained clout so Hamas has made powerful and rich friends 
Turkey a resurgent regional power that was once Israels closest Muslim ally has taken up Hamass cause so has Qatar one of the richest and most dynamic of the Gulf states 
Jubilant Hamas people say an Islamist crescent is curving around Israel from Lebanon in the north where the Hizbullah partycummilitia holds sway through Syria where rebels of an increasingly Islamist bent may topple Bashar Assad and on down through Jordan where Hamass allies are menacing the king 
Above all on Israels southern flank the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt by far the most populous and pivotal of Arab countries has changed the regions balance 
By contrast the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas and its leaders are more subject to popular opinion 
In future diplomacy Hamas may emerge as an actor that cannot be shut out even by Israel and America 
Meanwhile Israels hardliners will draw the opposite conclusions 
In military terms Hamas has been put back in its box 
Israels Iron Dome antimissile system has proved its worth and many of Hamass missiles have been destroyed 
Israelis will sleep more soundly for a while 
In diplomatic terms America is as steadfast as ever many European countries also blamed Hamas for starting the latest round of violence 
Above all Israel has prospered especially under Binyamin Netanyahu a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process 
Why coddle those twisty Palestinians by giving them a state of their own 
If they really ran the West Bank would they not fire rockets just as their compatriots have done in Gaza 
Better to keep them behind that wall and smite them if they raise their heads 
Maybe the hardliners will win out yet the Arab spring may change their calculations 
Even if the Islamists taking power in Egypt and elsewhere have little love for Israel their priority will be tackling difficulties at home 
Israels defence budget is bigger than that of its four Arab neighbours combined 
Starting a war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments mend their economies 
That the pragmatic Mr Morsi worked with Barack Obama to obtain a ceasefire augurs well and might just mark the start of something 
Israelis too should look to the longer term 
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic depriving Palestinians of their right to selfdetermination is creating a powder keg that is bound one day to explode in the territories occupied by Israel much as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week 
Repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demography exacerbates this as the Arab population swells 
Bloody missions against Gaza every few years to knock back Hamas will exact a growing diplomatic toll 
Both sides need prodding by outsiders
The answer remains the one trumpeted by sensible people on both sides most of the outside world and this newspaper two states with Israel ceding territory for security 
The hope a small one in the short term is that the ceasefire will give a little more leverage to outsiders pushing that cause 
Arab outsiders should also press Hamas and Fatah to come together 
That would do more to create a Palestinian state than the imminent bid for virtual statehood at the UN 
Mr Obama also has a part in getting Israel to the table 
During his first term he neglected to present his own plan for peace 
Back in the White House he is looking just as reluctant to be drawn in 
This is woefully shortsighted 
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East 
That means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians 
Cigarette plain packaging laws come into force in Australia
Smoking warnings and diseased body parts emblazoned on dull green boxes that are the same for all tobacco brands
Australias worldfirst laws on cigarette and tobacco plain packaging have come into force replacing brand logos and colours with generic drab olive green coverings gruesome pictures of diseased body parts and depictions of children and babies made ill by their parents smoking 
Apart from the varying health warnings and images the only difference between the packs mandatory from Saturday are the brand names and these are all printed in identical small font 
It is the worlds most strict regime for the packaging of tobacco 
Australias federal government says the aim is to deter young people from smoking by stripping the habit of glamour 
While Australia has one of the worlds lowest smoking rates and the changes will have little impact on multinationals profits other countries are considering similar steps 
The tobacco industry lobbied hard against the laws 
Tobacco firms said they would boost black market trade leading to cheaper more accessible cigarettes 
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring lots more of these products down to sell on the streets of Australia 
Others say the laws have boosted their business 
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd a small family business said demand for cigarette cases silicon covers to mask the unpalatable packages had shot up from almost nothing two months ago since British American Tobacco Britains Imperial Tobacco Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the laws in Australias high court 
This is good business for us 
The potential hitch experts say is the popularity of social media with the very demographic the plan is targeting 
After a series of Australian laws banning TV advertising and sports sponsorship and requiring most sellers to hide cigarettes from view tobacco marketing has moved online 
Australia has banned web advertising by local companies and sites but cannot restrict overseas sites 
We have to ask is that just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and theyve gone to the trouble of making a video or is there a marketing company involved 
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry was focused on dealing with the new rules rather than marketing 
The industry has gone as far as paying for Ukraine Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules the countries are claiming at the World Trade Organisation that trade is being unfairly restricted despite none of the countries having significant trade with Australia 
Plibersek said the government had held discussions with other countries considering similar laws on packaging 
Tougher laws are being considered in Britain New Zealand South Africa and India 
Many smokers in Australia remain defiant 
The pictures dont affect me 
I just ignore them 
Honestly theres only one reason Id stop and thats my little girl 
James Yu who runs the King of the Pack tobacconist in central Sydney said the uniform packaging made it harder to stack his shelves
In a Constantly PluggedIn World Its Not All Bad to Be Bored
I spent five unexpected hours in an airport this Thanksgiving holiday when our plane had mechanical difficulties and we had to wait for another plane to arrive 
So I had plenty of time to think about the subject of boredom 
I wont lie to you 
Half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is pretty tedious even with the distractions of books magazines and iPhones not to mention dutyfree shopping 
But increasingly some academics and child development experts are coming out in praise of boredom 
Its all right for us and our children to be bored on occasion they say 
It forces the brain to go on interesting tangents perhaps fostering creativity 
And because most of us are almost consistently plugged into one screen or another these days we dont experience the benefits of boredom 
So should we embrace boredom 
Yes 
And no 
But Ill get back to that 
First of all like many people I assumed that boredom was a relatively recent phenomenon with the advent of more leisure time 
Theres Latin graffiti about boredom on the walls of Pompeii dating from the first century 
Then theres the question of how we define boredom 
The trouble is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways said John D Eastwood an associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario Canada 
What separates boredom from apathy he said is that the person is not engaged but wants to be 
With apathy he said there is no urge to do something 
Boredom can sound an awful lot like depression 
But Professor Eastwood said that while they can be related people who are bored tend to see the problem as the environment or the world while people who are depressed see the problem as themselves 
Sometimes we think were bored when we just have difficulty concentrating 
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room others heard it at a low level so it was barely noticeable while the third group didnt hear the soundtrack at all 
The ones who heard the lowlevel TV reported more boredom than the other two groups they had difficulty concentrating but were not sure why and attributed that difficulty to boredom 
When youre trying to focus on a difficult or engaging task disruption of attention can lead to boredom said Mark J Fenske an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study 
In fact he said we now know that squirming and doodling often seen as a sign of boredom can actually help combat it by keeping people more physically alert 
We all experience boredom at some points my flight delay a droning speaker a particularly tedious movie 
But some individuals are more likely to be bored than others 
Using such scales researchers have discovered that boys tend to be bored more often than girls said Stephen Vodanovich a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida especially when it comes needing more and a variety of external stimulation 
But in general teenagers are a pretty jaded lot 
So back to my original question Is boredom good for you 
Sometimes no because in its extreme it can lead people to take absurd physical risks gamble or indulge in substance abuse as a way to ease it research shows 
On the other hand many philosophers and writers discuss the connection between boredom and creativity said Professor Vodanovich who has been studying the issue for more than two decades 
But the brain doesnt always know the most appropriate thing to do 
If youre bored and use that energy to play guitar and cook it will make you happy 
But if you watch TV it may make you happy in the short term but not in the long term 
So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad he may not be bored anymore but he hasnt learned how to entertain himself or self regulate Professor Fenske said 
Your kid doesnt just learn to entertain himself but gets more selfcontrol in other areas 
I dont think we really want to celebrate boredom 
Nor should we be too critical of it 
Rather our goal should be to feel comfortable away from the constant chatter of activity and technology 
Professor Eastwood agreed 
What people are really searching for he said is a way to unplug and enjoy down time 
In Colorado No Playbook for New Marijuana Law
Mr Orozco said that one day in September he and a few friends were driving in Lamar on the plains near the Kansas border when they were pulled over 
But is he one 
In the uncertain weeks after Colorados vote to legalize small amounts of marijuana for recreational use the answer in hundreds of minor drug cases depends less on the law than on location 
Hundreds of misdemeanor marijuana cases are already being dropped here and in Washington State which approved a similar measure 
But prosecutors in more conservative precincts in Colorado have vowed to press ahead with existing marijuana cases and are still citing people for possession 
At the same time several towns from the Denver suburbs to the Western mountains are voting to block new statelicensed retail marijuana shops from opening in their communities 
Regulators in Washington State are also scratching their heads 
They say that Colorado for better or worse is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana first for medical use and now recreationally 
But no place or system Mr Smith conceded can do more than suggest what might work 
Chief Oates said that the police would enforce city codes regulating medical marijuana growers and that they would still pursue drug traffickers and dealers 
In northern Colorados Weld County the district attorney Ken Buck represents a stricter view 
After the vote he said his office would continue pursuing marijuana possession cases mostly as a way to press users into getting treatment 
The response has been complicated even in places like rural Mesa County where voters rejected the marijuana initiative 
The police in Grand Junction the countys largest city are no longer citing adults for possession of small amounts 
The countys district attorney Pete Hautzinger supported that decision but also decided not to dismiss all of the pending possession cases 
And the contradictory reactions across the state lay bare a deep ambivalence among local officials about the states big green experiment 
As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana like alcohol Colorado and Washington are poised to become national test cases for drug legalization 
As advocates and state officials plan for a new frontier of legalized sales they are also anxiously awaiting direction from the federal government which still plans to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes 
Advocates for legalized marijuana are hoping the Justice Department yields 
While drug agents will probably not beat down doors to seize a small bag of the drug they are likely to balk at allowing the stateregulated recreational marijuana shops allowed under the new laws said Kevin A Sabet a former drug policy adviser in the Obama administration 
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for federal authorities to act 
Even before Election Day some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana shops even though it will be about a year before any can open 
Last week the western city of Montrose took up a sixmonth ban and is likely to pass it next week 
Our community voted against this amendment 
Were looking at what the community voted for versus what the state voted for 
Theres an awful lot of questions 
Petronella Wyatt I was bullied out of Oxford for being a Tory
It is not just todays university students who are attacked for their views
I cant remember a time when I didnt dream of winning a place at Oxford University 
Both my father and my elder brother had been at what I imagined was the worlds greatest seat of learning a modernday wineblushed Greek symposium encouraging the dual pillars of civilisation free thinking and tolerance 
Yet within two weeks of taking up my place at Worcester College in the late Eighties to read history Id packed my bags precipitating the first scandal of my life 
My father broke down and cried 
Friends were baffled 
The Evening Standard diary claimed Id quit because I objected to fellow undergraduates having sex in the room next to mine 
The writer A N Wilson announced waggishly that Id departed because I was forced to drink out of chipped mugs 
The truth was less droll 
I ran away 
Yes ran because I had been subject to systematic bullying and intimidation 
Not on account of my rather outr name or the fact that I came from a private school 
I was persecuted for one reason only and in this cradle of supposed enlightenment it was both bigoted and barbaric my father the late Woodrow Wyatt was a highprofile adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a Conservative supporter 
Why bring this up now you might ask 
Well recent reports suggest that a new generation of Rightofcentre students are suffering a similar persecution 
Such is the institutionalised and increasing hatred of Tory students at Oxford that last week a group of them demanded the same equalrights protection as gays disabled people and ethnic minorities 
They want to create a post on the colleges equal opportunities committee to ensure that their opinions can be aired freely 
Their situation wasnt helped by a recent BBC Two documentary Wonderland Young Bright and on the Right about student politics which portrayed Tories as oddballs and neoNazis 
It featured graduate Joe Cooke former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association OUCA travelling in a RollsRoyce sporting a silver suit and silvertopped cane 
I was in a minority of one during my first few weeks at Oxford 
Hatred of the Conservative Party was at its most febrile 
The year before the university had voted to refuse Margaret Thatcher a former student an honorary degree because of cuts in higher education funding 
The atmosphere would have made a Stalinist shudder with apprehension 
I was to find that the dons not only connived in the taunting of Tory undergraduates but took part with relish 
I stumbled over it 
A small man with a face like cake batter Pitt was big on bile 
The other undergraduates giggled 
Tears pricked the back of my eyes 
I walked back to my rooms a disconsolate figure 
At dinner in college that evening I sat by myself then I felt a light tap on my shoulder 
It was a secondyear English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA 
Im afraid its like that 
Anyone suspected of being a Tory is picked on 
Its bad enough for me but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher so it will be worse for you 
Most Tory freshers pretend theyre Labour 
Later at a local pub I cravenly attempted to dissimulate 
I insisted that I didnt agree with everything Mrs Thatcher said 
This ploy proved unsuccessful 
Youre contaminated 
Other students took up the refrain 
I was perverted dirty 
They beat each other dont they 
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the liberal legislation of the Sixties 
Would I ever be able to lead a normal life at Oxford 
Would I be forced to meet likeminded people only after dark 
Would I have to turn to Labour and suppress my natural inclinations 
The three years before me stretched out as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation 
The only openly Tory don was Norman Stone Professor of Modern History who was based at my college 
He was hated for being not only a Conservative but a foreign policy adviser to Thatcher and one of her speech writers 
He was hardly ever there 
He loathed the place as provincial and petty and for its adherence to the Marxistdeterminist view of history 
I told my father I hated Oxford and why 
He was incredulous 
During his time there in the Forties all political views had been accepted 
They wouldnt do that not among my dreaming spires 
Even my Communist friends always had impeccable manners 
His rheumy eyes began to cloud 
Give it a chance 
Im sure its all just a tease 
It would break my heart if you left 
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London my emotional resistance was deteriorating 
A male friend of mine also a Tory supporter had succumbed to pressure and renounced his creed 
The respite was short 
It was my father who drove the nail into the coffin of my Oxford career 
At the time he wrote two columns in the Murdoch press each week 
My door was locked 
I cowered inside and after five minutes my pursuers gave up 
When they left I packed a suitcase and caught the first train to London 
I never went back 
You may call me a snivelling wimp 
Somerset House former home of Queen Elizabeth I of England is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting a Valentino Garavani exhibition 
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rarefied and distant world of the nobility 
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as if they were trophies of his social ascent from humble couturier in Voghera northern Italy to idol of the international jetset 
There is nothing wrong with loving royalty 
Valentino is a spectacular host whose entertains with generosity and elegance 
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety 
And yet he is a star 
Valeria Mazza wearing a Valentino 
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also recalls the couturiers charisma 
Many years ago after a fashion show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome we went for dinner at his flat 
There were twenty of us including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr 
Nobility parade
Garavanis life is not a story of obsession but of well reciprocated love 
He loves welleducated people who come from good backgrounds and they love him 
In this crowd of mannequins names stand out such as Sibilla of Luxembourg Gloria von Thurn und Taxis MetteMarit of Norway Rosario of Bulgaria and Sofia of Habsburg 
I remember it perfectly 
Their proportions are perfect 
The princess and fashion advisor Patricia della Giovampaola dArenberg also remembers the first time she wore a Valentino 
As a teenager living in Italy I dreamed of reaching the age when Id have the chance to wear one of his evening gowns 
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear at a party in the castle belonging to my cousin Prince Edouard de Ligne 
Cavaliere di Gran Croce the highestranking distinction in Italy Cavaliere del Lavoro Commandeur de LOrdre des Arts et des Lettres and awarded the Legion of Honour Garavani accumulates as many honours as any of his clients husbands 
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum 
He was on the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes a great friend of mine 
If a princess says that 
The hardest job in the world the human mules of Kawah Ijen
There are people for whom work is hell and others who literally work in hell 
To do so he has to descend every day to the bottom of the crater where the sulphurous gas emanating from the bowels of the earth solidifies on contact with air 
They know that one slip could cost them their lives as happened to a French tourist who plunged to her death a few years ago on the hazardous Kawah Ijen cliffs 
Although it seems a pittance for such an inhuman effort it is three times what he would earn in the field 
Anto has asthma he has difficulty breathing coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases 
He has asthma he has difficulty breathing coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases from the volcano 
This is the price you have to pay to realise your dreams 
Punished for life this pleasant intelligent young man could be a tour guide waiter or hotel receptionist but instead he does the work of a mule 
Sharing a filthy wooden hut with other porters he gets up every day at two in the morning because the sulphur doesnt stop flowing at night when its characteristic yellow colour turns blue and it glows in the dark 
Defying the shadows Anto descends the crater and lights the path with a small torch attached to the helmet he bought with his money 
Despite their huge profits the mining company has not mechanised the sulphur extraction process to save costs nor has it provided any equipment for the porters who work for themselves and by the kilo 
I wont retire Ill die here because the volcano has been my whole life 
Although the sulphur burns your throat and stings your eyes when the wind suddenly changes and traps the miners in the thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano they are so hardy that noone complains of serious illnesses apart of course from their common respiratory problems osteoarthritis knee pain and sores on the shoulders which have been misshapen by the weight of the baskets 
Time passes but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation in one of the hardest jobs in the world the one done by human mules in the Kawah Ijen volcano 
Singapore seeks babies to save its economy
Singaporeans blame their careers stress and the cost of property and education for not having children 
Im a patriotic husband youre my patriotic wife lets do our civic duty and create life 
It may seem unlikely that these verses are part of an advert for mint sweets but in spite of this or perhaps because of it the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year 
The advertising company that made the video BBH is hopeful that the advertisement will manage to focus attention to the problem in a fun way 
Its purely an Internet thing so we had to make it fun and amusing 
Its the biggest problem facing this country 
We are the worlds worst at reproducing our own progeny so we felt it was an issue we had to address 
We knew the Government had tried many things like launching perfumes with pheromones or organising speed dating evenings 
Many of these ideas may have been creative but they didnt necessarily work 
So we thought why not be as creative as possible to solve the problem by composing a rap 
But the Singapore Government is not taking it so lightly 
But this has all had little effect 
Singapore is a rich high technology city State in Southeast Asia also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls 
So why are Singaporeans not having children 
These changes in social norms have contributed to increasing numbers of people who are single and delaying marriage and births which has resulted in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore 
Meanwhile an EU immigration policy aimed at dramatically increasing immigration to cope with the population decline has created resentment among the local population 
In Singapore there are websites where xenophobia against many new immigrants is widespread and thinly disguised especially the Chinese who are criticised for keeping wages low and not integrating 
Increased immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the Singapore ruling party experienced its worst election result since independence 
Since the election there has been an attempt to correct the problem with the highest taxes and levies for foreign workers 
Unexpected consequences
While a fall in the birth rate has known effects on a nations economic growth tax revenues healthcare costs and immigration policies in Singapores case there are also some unexpected consequences 
The Government is trying not to build so many small houses 
For example it has started to influence the real estate sector 
However there is concern that they may promote a singleliving lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large family houses 
They are more popular in the sense that the units sell days even weeks faster than larger units 
This means they are much better for our cash flow 
However he admits that the new regulations give clearer guidance to developers who previously had obstacles put in their way if they provided for too many small units in a project 
Too stressed
Singapore is a city State 
Although these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate when talking to Singaporeans working in the central financial district it seems they will not have much impact 
Other people can have children 
Men and women alike mention their careers stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons preventing them from having children 
So much as the Government is trying to encourage its citizens to have children when it comes to babies the Singaporeans have the last word 
What is private offline is private online
Privacy 
How do you apply this definition to their daily life and social networks 
Do they understand the dangers they are exposed to by airing information over the Internet which they probably would not share offline 
On FB I upload nice pictures or games 
And I have fun with people I know 
The child recognises that it is bad to post obscene pictures of naked people crimes or write humiliating or aggressive comments 
Most are relatives 
His mother is included and she has the password to one of the accounts 
I opened Twitter to express myself and post interesting tweets 
He does not hesitate to reply that he would never accept a request from an unknown person 
Nor would he take any notice of someone who recommends a stranger to him 
The boy says that noone has suggested anything to him or asked him for his home address or phone number 
Joseph became a follower on Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter 
This teenager is not alien to experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying 
An acquaintance of a friend of mine was being pestered on a social network 
They were threatening him and demanding money from him 
The victim according to Jos did not close his account 
He then explains a series of steps to configure the account safely 
Unlike Jorge this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations 
I would do it if I didnt like somebody or they made me want to do it 
Key questions
Marielos Porras an English teacher with a degree in Education and Learning believes that to guide children and teenagers they should understand that the purpose of social media is to inform 
Porras says the scholar Marc Prensky with a Masters degree in Education from Yale University and author of the work Digital Natives Digital Immigrants coined these terms to explain the phenomenon 
Digital natives are those children and young people born with technology 
According to the specialist the most effective way to teach children and teenagers what privacy is is through questions that make them think 
Porras then lists some options There are things you wouldnt tell a stranger so why do it online 
Or would you like a friend to publish a photo of you like the one you posted of a friend 
Do you know what others publish about you 
When tagging party photos did you ask the other peoples permission to tag them 
And one more question does everyone need to know what youre doing all the time 
Another point is to make them see that they must behave online as they do offline 
The rules are the same 
Monitoring
Stuart Guard a university professor primary school teacher and educational consultant says it is essential for parents to read social networks policies thoroughly 
By understanding all the clauses they have solid grounds to talk to their children about the implications of opening an online account 
Unasur Summit closes without making public the Lima Declaration
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations Unasur concluded today in Peru without making public the Lima Declaration previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven attendee leaders 
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the Sixth UNASUR Meeting of Heads of State and Government but Presidential and Chancellery sources initially said they would deliver it after the summit closed but later they claimed that it will be published at some point on the Peruvian Government website 
When asked about the text they pointed out that the content had been disclosed by Peruvian President Ollanta Humala during a brief statement to the press 
Journalists access to information from the Summit was restricted at all times 
The little information that circulated among reporters was given by the press spokesmen of some of the UNASUR governments attending the meeting but not the Peruvian Government 
The only document released during the summit was the list of attending presidents which angered hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more details 
Last October Peru hosted the Third Summit of South AmericanArab Countries ASPA and this time despite repeated requests from the press the previously announced Lima Declaration was again not made public 
The ASPA official website confirms that the document was published last Tuesday 
At both international events the Peruvian authorities were at pains to ensure that there were broadcasting systems assured for all the journalists but limited the obtaining of information to a maximum 
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling by the Hague Court to adjudicate a border dispute between the two countries 
The Presidents of Peru Ollanta Humala and Chile Sebastin Piera met during the regional event and confirmed that they will respect the decision of the International Court of Justice ICJ which on Monday at The Hague will start to hear the arguments of both parties in the lawsuit Lima has filed against Santiago 
Confirmation of both presidents that they would submit to the ICJ came after Colombia this week denounced the Bogot Pact whereby it accepted to submit to the judgement of this international court following a decision on its maritime boundary with Nicaragua which it regarded as seriously flawed 
The summit was held with the absence of the Presidents of Brazil Dilma Rousseff Venezuela Hugo Chavez Bolivia Evo Morales and Argentina Cristina Kirchner 
Host President Ollanta Humala was responsible for opening the session in the morning and closing the summit just after noon in Lima 
Among these projects he mentioned that five are in Peru and are located in the transverse axes of its territory between the coast and Brazil and two focus on increased connection with Ecuador although he gave no further details 
Also the final document mentioned the political situation in Paraguay 
The need for Latin America to remain a prosperous peaceful and integrated nation with good neighbourly relations was another issue highlighted by the summit 
In this sense the President of Colombia Juan Manuel Santos said before attending the start of the regional event that he expected to meet with his counterpart from Nicaragua Daniel Ortega on Saturday in Mexico to respectfully discuss the maritime dispute after the failure of the ICJ questioned by Bogota 
Santos and Ortega are due to meet on Saturday in Mexico where they expect to attend the inauguration of the countrys new President Enrique Pea Nieto 
Argentina Bolivia Colombia Ecuador Peru Brazil Uruguay Venezuela Chile Guyana Surinam and Paraguay make up UNASUR although the latter is currently suspended 
Peru has the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc 
To this end he defended the project to establish South American citizenship encouraged by member countries of UNASUR 
The Ecuadorian President was also in favour of the restructuring of the Organisation of American States OAS under the premise of reducing the influence of the AngloSaxon states and taking into account those who have signed the Pact of San Jos on human rights 
Those who speak with authority never commit to anything whereas we South Americans sign everything 
Correa said that there is a risk of deterioration of Assanges physical and mental health 
What there is is the danger that his physical and mental health may deteriorate due to being locked in a small space without any outdoor exercise 
Correa said that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange in June by the Ecuadorian Embassy in London through the issue of a safeconduct pass that permits travel to Ecuador is in the hands of Great Britain Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London to seek a solution to the imprisonment of the WikiLeaks founder 
We do not negotiate with human rights we do not use that word in this case but there have been ongoing discussions 
And if Sweden as its legislation perfectly well allows it to do and as it has done in other cases questions Mr Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or interrogates him via Skype tomorrow this problem is over 
For now that ruling is not being followed 
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American one 
Conflict is inevitable but must be overcome by the desire to walk together 
They need to be processed in a comprehensive manner to overcome them and move forward 
Personally Ive never been interested in power but in situations as unjust as those in Ecuador socioeconomic poverty can only be corrected by political power 
If I won it would be my last period in office and then I would leave public life 
If I lose likewise 
Correa also referred to Venezuelan President Hugo Chavezs new health treatment in Cuba 
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicols Maduro and he tells me that Chavez went for treatment that was already planned routine treatment and it was expected he would win the campaign and return to Cuba 
In Lima today the Ecuadorian Head of State attended the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations UNASUR which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress equality and security 
Deaths caused by AIDS are nowadays due to late detection
The boy hid it from his family 
At that time having Aids was synonymous with death 
Now it is possible to survive the syndrome and do so with quality of life 
 Why are do still deaths occur 
 I think the problem is not to do with access to treatment 
Thats how I view it and thats how its been at our hospital 
Specialists and officials of the State Council of AIDS Prevention in Jalisco COESIDA agree on this proposal as do the patients themselves such as Fabrizio who came to be tested at a private laboratory motivated only because a friend had done so and despite his young age he was around in the AIDS era and had even suffered Kaposi sarcoma a cancerous tumour that is one of the common complications 
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS 
Some people think theyre going to die and dont want to know anything 
The change was for the better I eat well I exercise I take my drugs 
To date his parents are only aware he had cancer 
I live as normal a life as anyone else 
They should get tested if they are at risk because the sooner they know if they are HIV positive the better and if they have already been diagnosed they must learn to live like any other person while being responsible 
Condoms behind the counter 
The gaps between health programmes and ordinary citizens are huge said Ricardo Salazar a journalist from Guadalajara who has taken up the HIV cause 
And the greatest cure is prevention 
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers 
It was decided to change such inefficient allocation and that condoms should not only be placed behind counters but that packets of one hundred should be found in public toilet dispensers in places frequented by young people 
This is not promoting promiscuity 
It is not about paying for their beers or motel fees as Governor Emilio Gonzalez said when asked if there would be distribution of condoms during his administration 
Jalisco key points
Ratified by a United States court of appeal a judgement which ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Groups debt achieved via a bankruptcy in Mexico the scenario is an ominous precedent for any national company with offices in the neighbouring country that has solvency problems 
It seems then that the proceedings in support of survival of firms permit Mexican law are not valid in the land of stars and stripes contrary to international conventions 
However the decision opens the door for the leading glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States claiming three inconsistencies 
From the start while the trial judge notes that creditors should be governed by the United States Bankruptcy Code the Court of Appeal for the Fifth Circuit based in New Orleans states that the main action is the insolvency action handled in Mexico 
The first point would involve ignoring international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with transnational profiles 
Indeed the UN Model Law for International Trade Law Uniformity was created for this purpose with the American Law Institute positioned as arbitrator 
Secondly the judgement establishes that without the intercompany vote with the debts the Vitro subsidiaries had with their parent company recognised in the critical mass of the insolvency the majority needed to approve the restructuring might not be achieved 
However Mexican law recognises the possibility 
In fact the Vitro case was not the first one in which the scheme was accepted 
There are half a dozen examples including Agremex and Commercial Mexicana whose intercompany debts were endorsed by the Federal Bankruptcy Institute 
This data is omitted by the Court of Appeal 
For now the Gonzalez Sada family firm has lodged a motion for reconsideration before the Court of Appeal for the vote to reach the plenary of the court that is the five judges given that only three voted previously 
Should this fail an appeal for review by a higher court in this case the US Supreme Court will be filed 
Moreover it should be noted that the country yielded to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade that is the rules set for crossborder insolvency cases ensuring fairness for debtors and creditors 
Double whammy Vitro hit and country hit 
Balance Sheet
With the complaints put on the table by the unions of Mexicana Airlines against the former owner of the company Gastn Azcrraga Andrade who is accused of mismanagement dormant for several months the Airline Pilots Union Association already found the bottleneck 
The proceedings headed by Carlos Diaz Chavez Morineau has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Securities Commission which is accused of obstructing justice 
The resources were apparently channelled towards the purchase of shares in the company Administradora Profesional de Hoteles 
As you know Azcarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain 
Opposing Dragon Mart
A group of local and foreign environmentalists academics businessmen and members of the public gathered at the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean to approve the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun 
Previously Canacintra had managed to unite the governors of the southeast of Mexico to oppose the monumental building that destroyed part of a protected area and represents the mother of all threats to industry 
The death of ACTA
The Government ignored an order of the Senate to explain under what terms and conditions the Mexican Ambassador in Japan signed the AntiCounterfeiting Trade Agreement known by its acronym ACTA according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property and the matter has already been archived 
As you know the action was taken even though the Senate had ruled out the possibility deeming it an infringement of freedom of expression on social networks 
Homex long term
Birth of Competival
A consortium under the name Competival has just been established comprising the companies NYCE eQuality and Kernet leaders in information technology the objective of which will be to market the services of software clusters in Central and South America 
Reyes is not exaggerating when he makes that statement 
The walls of his house are almost totally decorated with pictures and memorabilia denoting his long career which goes to prove it 
Bayamn at heart
Do you want him 
And that was the beginning of Mincy one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had 
Bartow then recommended the sharpshooter Gausse Raymond who established residency here and was one of our best shooters 
I remember him saying that if Mincy had given Bayamon one championship Gausse would help get another 
For that time he preferred to enjoy his own and Mincys accomplishments in the national team 
With role players such as Canito Nieves Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended after the shambles of the Mar del Plata PanAmerican Games we won gold against all the odds 
Who was the best Puerto Rican player 
Without any doubt Piculn Ortiz 
His numbers at international tournament level are awesome 
Nobody in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level like Piculn did 
Not to mention his career in the various leagues he played in 
Who was the best Puerto Rican manager 
Thats a difficult one 
We had a very good team including Julio Toro Flor Melendez Carlos Morales Raymond Dalmau Armandito Torres 
Of the youngsters I really like the work of Leo Arill 
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation 
What was there left for you to do 
There were things Id have liked to implement such as regionalising the minor leagues 
For example the boys of Ponce only play in their area and only get to face teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs 
Right now the kids are riding and playing too much unnecessarily 
At least I see the fruit of compulsory certifications and a course for leaders table officials and referees 
That pleases me 
What are you doing now 
The most I do is listen to music watch music videos from my era on YouTube enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games 
And of course enjoy the company of my wife Elizabeth who has always been with me 
Actor Larry Hagman dies
Larrys family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving Day holiday 
Linda Gray who played his wife in the original series and the sequel was with Hagman when he died in a hospital in Dallas said her publicist Jeffrey Lane 
He brought joy to all who knew him 
He was creative generous funny loving and talented and I will miss him dearly 
He played Captain Tony Nelson an astronaut whose life is changed when he meets an attractive genie played by Barbara Eden and takes her home to live with him 
But it was his masterful interpretation of delightfully detestable JR that led to Hagman reaching his peak of stardom 
It also helped give the series a record audience at the time 
It was JRs sisterinlaw Kristin played by Mary Crosby who shot him 
JR got her pregnant then threatened to say she was a prostitute unless she left town but there were others who also had reasons to attack him 
Hagman portrayed Ewing as a corrupt insatiable man with a charismatic smile a dishonest entrepreneur and cheating husband who tried to have his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen Linda Gray sectioned 
This is the only deal he lost 
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of fans around the world and in the hearts of each one of us who was fortunate enough to know and love him 
He had already finished recording five episodes for the second series and a sixth was in process the chain reported 
Immediately after there was no statement from Warner or TNT about how the series would handle the loss of Hagman 
While there he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her 
The couple had two sons Preston and Heidi and lived for a long time in the Californian city Malibu home to many celebrities 
After his liver transplant he became an organ donation promoter and worked as a volunteer at a hospital helping fearful patients 
He was also an antismoking activist and took part in several campaigns 
Each week students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war zombies viruses and germs and global warming 
And remember that bad is good for those with an apocalyptic mentality 
Each week students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war zombies viruses and germs and global warming 
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists for example a war could break out 
This month students analysed movies with an apocalyptic theme and explored how they compare with reallife examples 
The courses proved quite popular 
We received emails for weeks and weeks before the start of the term from people asking if there were any places 
Students meanwhile say the course is one of the most interesting around 
And the apocalyptic secular or religious mentality is just a matter consolation or a lack of it 
I enjoy it 
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world it is just a key point in the calendar said Restall 
But he said that Western culture suffers from apocalyptic anxiety which goes back several centuries in which people react to changes around them by predicting the end of the world 
The Internet has caused a boom in these speculations 
Its mostly in the Englishspeaking world 
We have an indulgence from the Pope 
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly
