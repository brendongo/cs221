Parliament Does Not Support Amendment Freeing Tymoshenko
Today the Ukraine parliament dismissed within the Code of Criminal Procedure amendment the motion to revoke an article based on which the opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko was sentenced 
The amendment that would lead to freeing the imprisoned former Prime Minister was revoked during second reading of the proposal for mitigation of sentences for economic offences 
In October Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for entering into what was reported to be a disadvantageous gas deal with Russia 
The verdict is not yet final the court will hear Tymoshenkos appeal in December 
Tymoshenko claims the verdict is a political revenge of the regime in the West the trial has also evoked suspicion of being biased 
Libyas Victory
The story of Libyas liberation or rebellion already has its defeated 
Muammar Kaddafi is buried at an unknown place in the desert Without him the war is over 
It is time to define the winners 
As a rule Islamists win in the country the question is whether they are the moderate or the radical ones 
The transitional cabinet declared itself a follower of the customary Sharia law of which we have already heard 
Libya will become a crime free country as the punishment for stealing is having ones hand amputated 
Women can forget about emancipation potential religious renegades will be executed etc 
Instead of a dictator a society consisting of competing tribes will be united by Koran 
Libya will be in an order we cannot imagine and surely would not ask for 
However our lifestyle is neither unique nor the best one and would not most probably be suitable for for example the people of Libya 
In fact it is a wonder that the Islamic fighters accepted help from the nonbelievers 
Their only excuse is that from their point of view NATO raids were not controlled by an American general but Allah the greatness of whom they celebrated with each strike 
When winners are sought for in Libya the West is not on the list 
We participated in a shooting served Islam and our politicians got rid of a dictator their political ally without any guarantee of profit 
Given the recent bad experience from Afghanistan and Iraq we decided against military occupation of Libya 
Without the occupation will the oil companies get Libyas black gold for next to nothing though 
It is quite likely that they will not The West will then finally be able to boast about its selfless protection of human rights 
Unless the followers of the Sharia law put a stop to that 
New Era of Crisis Commences
A statistical storm blew over Europe on Tuesday 
Between quarters the Czech economy stagnated Germany and France are growing 
Yet the debit market is breaking records today 
Investors are no longer looking at only Italy they now focus on Spain France Austria and others 
Eurozone statistical offices in Germany Czech Republic and some other countries released their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter 
Between the quarters though the GDP stagnated According to the Czech Statistical Office this confirmed the trend of a gradual slowing of economic growth 
The results are worse than estimates by analysts 
Key events 
Earnings of both Italian and Spanish bonds are growing towards critical limits 
Even Austria Netherlands France and Belgium etc are beginning to experience problems 
Voices are coming from Germany suggesting that ECB be the last resort creditor 
Czechs qualified for EURO 
Football representation successfully managed the toughest task of the season 
In the second half Czech football was lucky to maintain its luxury lead from the home return match and will again feature at the European Championship 
IHNEDcz watched the progress match in a detailed report 
Nearly no excitement in the first half and a great portion of luck in the other 
Perfect Czech team defence only allowed the Montenegro team to threaten in the second half 
Damjanovic and Vucinic became the matchs least lucky couple after losing two great opportunities 
From the opening minutes the game was very pugnacious 
Both teams found it difficult to join in the combination the game remained around the midfield line most of the time 
That was also why there was no pressure from the home team in the first half Long kicks behind the defence were neatly averted by the Czech defence 
Iranian Students Are Prepared to Die for Their Countrys Nuclear Program
They created a live shield 
Several hundred university students created a live chain around the nuclear power plant in Iran 
The gesture is to express their support of their countrys nuclear program against a possible Israel attack 
At Tuesday noon students prayers in front of the building were followed by their chanting of death to both the USA and Israel 
In Isfahan Iran several hundred university students created a live chain around Isfahan Uranium Conversion Facility 
This way they express their readiness to protect their countrys nuclear program with their own lives 
In its recent report the International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA stated that everything leads to the conclusion that Iran has not stopped striving for a nuclear weapon 
Possible attack on Iran nuclear facilities has been discussed in Israel 
At Tuesday noon students prayers in front of the entrance into Isfahan Uranium Conversion Facility were followed by their chanting of death to both the USA and Israel 
In case of an attack aimed at the highest possible paralysation of the Iranian nuclear program the targets would be based on Israel press the facilities in both Isfahan and Natanz where the uranium is being enriched 
An Obese Childs Diet No breakfast and sausage for dinner
As a recent research shows obese children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyle 
Again we can see the importance of the environment and models surrounding a human being for his or her healthy development 
For example sausages occur up to half more frequently on the tables of obese children compared to the families of children with standard weight 
It was the second year of the Obesity is No Accident event supported by both Veobecn zdravotn pojiovna insurance company and Unilever 
Proper diet and sufficient sports activities represent key defining factors causing dramatically growing number of children who are either overweight or obese 
No lunch and sausage in the evening
Experts warn that even relative details are crucial for healthy development such as a regular time of family breakfast 
In a majority of families everyone has breakfast separately 
The worst discovery was the fact that in one tenth of households people do not have breakfast at all 
Yet breakfast is the core of proper daily diet 
A survey has shown that fries are consumed more often in the families of obese children 
Compose your own menu
Their favourite meals include large number of flour meat and sweet dishes 
As the main dish for lunch pasta won very tightly over poultry 
However children showed very little interest in legumes fish and vegetable lunches 
Tendency towards health
The survey also showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits provided they are given correct information 
This was quite significant for example in case of sweet soft drinks where more children would begin to prefer plain water 
In addition for their main course children ticked poultry and fish more often limiting sweet meals and dumplings 
A Stylist Must Also Be a Good Psychologist Professionals Claim
In the opening article on stylist training I was complaining a bit about the amount of information in the introductory lessons 
I had no idea what was coming 
Lectures by three experts from the field dressing tips for difficult figures and a seminar on how it works in practise 
And more is yet to come 
The closer we get to the final exam the more information and practical tasks await 
The training takes place every Saturday and Sunday but it is really packed with information 
This time together with Alenka the Director there is not a single man in the course we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not in perfect symmetry 
A majority of women are not perfectly symmetrical 
One has a short neck the other has a boyish figure without proper curves yet another is overweight 
A stylist must know how to optically soften wide shoulders make the neck look longer or add the curves necessary 
We were given tips on how to accentuate the figure of women such as Jennifer Lopez ie with bigger breasts and hips and narrow waist and not to dress them too provocatively 
For example if the difference between the waist and hips is such that the skirt or trousers do not fit it is worth to have at least one piece custommade 
You will definitely not regret the investment as perfectly fitting clothes are priceless 
In a custommade skirt you will feel much better than in one that keeps shifting rolling up sticking out in your waist etc 
Boyish figures on the other hand can wear clothes with ruffling appliqu embroidery or shirring 
Given the abundance of such information and figure types I am glad to have a whole week to sort it all out in my head 
Still I fear it is too much with regard to the homework we were given 
Each of the course participants was given a celebrity to create two outfits for day and night 
We must consider their current appearance their fashion style and figure type 
I am to dress Miranda Kerr whom you may know from the Victorias Secret campaigns 
Inside I rejoice as she is so much easier to dress than say Britney Spears Christina Aguilera who has recently gained about a ton please understand I am exaggerating or the very young Selena Gomez 
We must cut the clothes out of magazines or find them on the Internet and print and graphically process them 
Moodboard as the result is called then expresses our personal style and attitude to graphic depiction 
It is important to think about the graphic part of styling 
A stylist does not just dress physical people but creates product pages in magazines based on specific instructions for example trendy purses coats etc 
This is what a stylist and designer Mario Kamenk was telling us about 
But that was not until Sunday 
A stylist needs general knowledge
Saturdays lecture filled with information on figure types was livened up by three guests from the field 
A stylist Honza Pokorn a fashion designer Jakub Polanka and a fashion photographer Ben Ren 
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should be able to use this fact 
A good stylist can work with a single piece of clothing in different ways 
In this case variability is key 
For example a trench coat may be worn in the standard way over jeans and Tshirt as a coat but it may also be worn on naked body with stepins as a dress 
Another option is rolling up the sleeves or collar and the entire look changes completely 
aposThen you can start breaking them Jakub told us 
Here I finally understood why we drill all the definitions and rules of what to combine with what and why while in fashion magazines we often see something else 
Not to mention fashion shows 
From Ben the photographer I learned that a stylist must have more outfit versions prepared than the number he is to take pictures of 
So for a tenpage fashion story equals ten outfits I have to be ready to create at least fifteen of them 
Now I also know that in the picture a piece of clothing often looks and functions in combination with others completely different from reality 
We must therefore take that into consideration when creating an outfit 
Honza Pokorn confirmed that image and style often are half the success 
Just look at Madonna who is no miraculous singer yet her image and marketing turned her into a worldwide star 
The attitude towards stylist services is still rather cold in the Czech Republic 
Even famous people often consider it redundant believing it is sufficient to be good at something and how they look at it comes second 
And if someone finally lets us create their styling then we should expect them to give us different smaller size than what they really wear 
Then we are left to Google and find out if the tabloids wrote something about a celebrity gaining losing weight etc 
On Sunday both Honza and Mario were stressing the fact that for a stylist it is not enough to know about fashion and be able to create an outfit 
Our work chiefly consists of communicating with people we dress it is therefore important to be a good psychologist 
To be able to estimate people not to pander and stick to ones opinion 
He also showed us what specifically a duty bag must contain 
That is the bag you fasten around your waist to carry all the props you need 
Aside from the obvious things such as scissors a sticky roller or safety pins it should have a nylon thread for the stylist to use when taking pictures of products such as purses or hats special clipons for holding the clothes in the back in case it is too large pins and similar things are forbidden as they damage the clothes or a sewing set 
To have some change from listening and gain some practical experience we learned how to properly underlay shoe soles 
Even when taking photographs in a studio where the surface is even the soles might get damaged not to mention shooting outside 
And so we were sticking away 
You must not touch the shoes with the scissors to avoid any damage 
This requires real skill 
Mario pleased me by praising my job 
The skills mentioned are really not my cup of tea 
This is just a fragment of what we heard during the second weekend course session 
I am beginning to realise that to be a professional stylist is no piece of cake no matter what people say 
V Need for Speed The Run takes place across America 
Review
An originally carefree ride turned into a routine morning drive to work because of a series of completely superfluous and sloppy mistakes 
The ambitions were met to a certain point but it does not matter since nobody obviously wanted to do any extra work 
Before it was released the new version subtitled The Run created high expectations 
It promised to shift the old Need For Speed racing series in a new direction the demos made it look like a game that might stand up in the action racing genre 
We were curious to see the sections where the main character gets out of the car and runs 
Typical for the NFS series though in the end many things are different from what we expected 
The game represents a possibly decent arcade race but the whole is burdened by several unnecessary mistakes featured in the series for a number of years 
This means they are not really mistakes but the expression of an incomprehensible laziness of the developers 
The adventure opens very well 
You are introduced into a story where the main character Jack decides to solve some personal issues by participating in an illegal race across America 
You get in the car on the west coast in San Francisco and your task is to be the first one to reach New York 
The idea brings several interesting features 
The route is divided into ten stages subdivided into over fifty races 
This means each race takes place on a different route and given stages are set in varied and interesting environments 
One thus does not feel the game keeps offering the same things 
Despite the graphics being on the same level of previous parts of the series some of the environments are very nice to look at 
Still it is nothing worldshattering 
Driving through the desert autumnal countryside or high in snowcovered mountains is visually very pleasant though 
In addition the races are from time to time enlivened by an untypical feature 
For example in the desert you get into a sandstorm significantly decreasing the visibility 
On the other hand in the mountains you have to be careful not to get under an avalanche 
Individual races are ordered fairly well 
There are just a few types but it is sufficient 
For a while you try to overtake a number of competitors basically a regular race then you try to beat the time standard stopwatch race or you are in a duel with a single rival 
On top of everything else you sometimes come across the police who make your efforts more difficult 
The parts outside the car are new 
They are just interactive animations where most of the time Jack is running away from someone and you need to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time 
Nothing difficult 
It is a surprise though that these parts are much less in number than you would expect just three to be precise 
It actually turns out to be good for the game because this feature does not get to be boring within what was already said it is one of the things that make the game more entertaining 
The driving model follows the footsteps of the previous parts 
This means that it is nothing special anymore but it cannot be considered a negative 
If you are looking for a realtolife simulation you will have to look elsewhere 
Still this driving model is fully suitable for the action style racing even though we could find better at the competition 
So far everything is just right 
However after some time problems come 
In contrast with the driving model the collision model is not that good 
From a game of this type one does not expect complicated deformations and collisions but when you have no idea before crashing into any object how your car will act something is not right 
Typically when overtaking or passing cars tightly in common traffic you sometimes lightly touch the other car Yet sometimes in nearly identical situation your car ends up in wild pirouettes 
Or crashed completely 
This is not such a big deal due to the restart system but is enough to spoil the fun 
The restarts are done so that if you crash or get far off the track the game takes you back to the last interrupted point 
Nevertheless there are only five restarts available per each race 
If you use them up you have to start the race from the beginning 
This makes it an aid in case something does not work out but you cannot rely on it completely 
Sometimes the restarts are not enough and you need to learn a given section of the race by heart 
A significant shortcoming of the game is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places 
For example some turns have to be driven through in a specific way otherwise you simply do not fit in 
At other times you meet civilian cars at a given place in the very same configuration no matter if you come first fifth five seconds earlier or one minute later 
This is especially annoying in situations where you can see how your rival drives through the two cars coming in the opposite direction so easily while when you get there the cars are already positioned so that you have to either drive around or slow down 
It makes no difference when you get to them everything is set so that the situation always occurs just in front of your nose 
The competitors have other advantages too 
While playing the game you find several places where regardless of time the same competitor overtakes you at the very same spot 
This is most obvious at the end of the game on a long bridge where you are driving in the opposite direction 
Obviously your rival has to get in front of you no matter what 
The thing is that when he is driving in front of you he makes your vision worse which causes you to crash the car a few times in the section 
One can understand the attempt at making the game more interesting and adrenalinfilled but it is so obvious it gets annoying quickly 
Its a pity because despite the simple driving model the game is entertaining and sometimes even so full of action you do not have time to pay attention to what is happening around you 
It is not important whether the reason you do not get bored is the concept with fifty unique tracks ordering of races or something else 
The idea of changing cars during races is unusual 
You have to watch out for gas stations along the way as that is where you car may change despite the fact that in most of the cases the one you have is fully sufficient 
Cars are divided into three categories 
Sports cars are suitable for cities strong American cars for straight highway sections and exotic supersports cars for technical driving such as along crooked mountain tracks 
The key story mode is closely connected with the challenge mode these are the races in individual locations you know from the story 
Here you gain both medals and experience points for your profile common for both challenges and the story 
Various features unlock fir getting a higher driver level starting with cars and ending with profile backgrounds 
Again the profile is interconnected with an online Autolog function which among other things compares the results you have reached with those of other players and ensures community functions 
Yet another setback difficult to understand is the situation from the last race in the story 
You and your car get into a subway tunnel lets say you do where you speed down the tracks in the darkness lets say you do 
For several days our editorial staff kept discussing whether when designing the game no one thought for a moment or whether its authors really think we are such morons 
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary but the overall visual impression is mostly pleasant sometimes even great 
It is a pity though that in some dramatic moments the recording in some cases rather tragically decreases 
This especially concerns accidents with large number of participants where fluent recoding would not help you much anyway 
The sound is all right the soundtrack is a matter of taste 
In order to please the widest possible young audience the soundtrack is flecked in from all quarters but there probably will not be many people buying the game because of its music 
Overall impression of Need for Speed The Run is quite confused 
If the game avoided those clearly redundant mistakes we could sincerely say that The Run is the best part of NFS for the past several years 
However the game feels unfinished 
It surely is a nice entertainment but prepare to be blinded by the mistakes with the strength of airport spotlights

EU Ambassadress Vicenov 
Czechs have the reputation of being negative and eurosceptical
Moreover Vicenov praised the work of new longterm President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy 
No One Wants To Ban Our Cheese Specialties
Vicenov further focused on the agenda crucial for the EU in the past present and near future 
She described Czech presidency from the year before last as a success 
Czechs were dealing with the coming financial crisis they solved the as crisis and organised the East Partnership Summit 
She said the fall of the government at the time was a great negative causing significant damage to the Czech Republic 
Currently Czech representatives in the EU has been very busy 
As the ambassadress said both the presidency and the following financial crisis caused an ongoing stirring 
In addition a new sevenyear EU budget needs to be passed which is very complicated due to the current crisis 
Whether the budget will be slim and frugal which fields will be given preference which countries will be supported more and which less all of that is on the coming agenda 
How are citizens supposed to understand that in Brussels people are not trying to come up with crooked or round cucumbers different size bananas or that someone wants to ban our cheese specialtiesapos
She also wants to use the EU environment better and get more Czechs into European institutions 
Multispeed Europe Is Coming
The ambassadress says Czechs are said to be Eurosceptics as well as people noticing the negative rather than the positive sides of things 
She wishes more Czech representatives were involved in European institutions 
She thinks numerous factors are to blame for example the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivation letters together with low support from the Czech side 
Along with the success of Czech presidency she highlighted the power and cooperation of the Visegrad Group 
In the Unions future Vicenov expects mainly new strict rules for the budget policy of member states 
Rather than a new European Federation she finds the concept of twospeed if not multispeed Europe very realistic 
In this regard she appreciated the roles of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in pushing forward the rule based on which all topics influencing the entire EU should be negotiated by all member states and not just those belonging into the Eurozone 
Brand Story 
The IMB Innovator Starts the Second Century of Its Existence
To the wide public IMB is a symbol of technological revolution the company is seen as a highly temporary one yet it was founded over a hundred years ago 
The companys durability goes back to its first boss a visionary Thomas J Watson Sr
He believed in his motto saying that numerous world problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think 
Moreover it was the foundation of company culture Watson was building carefully 
IMB survived and flourished for a hundred years because it remained true to its original values while it was not afraid to change everything around itself 
During our first century this allowed us to transform the technology business and the company 
Sophisticated System
Just as sophisticated is IBMs longterm relationship with customers 
From the very beginning the company was brilliant in exploiting talented people It was one of the first world companies to abolish all discrimination which rendered it with great selection 
Consistent with the antidiscrimination strategy is the current plan expecting a woman Virginia Rometty to take over after Palmisano next year 
She has been working in IMB for thirty years she is currently a Director of Sales Marketing and Strategy 
In the last few years IMB has been organising jams online brainstorming sessions from which many future strategies and innovations arise 
It is no surprise that the ideas are plentiful the company employs nearly half a million people 
Institution with a Good Reputation
Companys strong business position is ensured by its strong internal and external image 
As the company itself says there is a difference between entering a market and creating it 
It seems to be the most universal technology company developing hardware and software infrastructure hosting and consultation services within a range from servers to nanotechnologies 
It holds the most patents of all American technology companies five of its employees were awarded the Nobel Price 
Its inventions include for example the cash point pay card financial swap bar code and floppy disc 
View Ahead
That is why IBM easily builds its foundations on many platforms if they do not work it leaves them 
This is how it differs from for example its competitor Microsoft which basically stands and falls on Windows its operating system 
Perspective Technology
IBMs revenues chiefly consist of services about one fifth for each comes from software and hardware 
IBM follows the legacy of its first director Thomas J Watson who increased the amount of investments during the Great Depression 
So far IMB seems to be getting through the current crisis without any harm 
IBMs company motto is to change everything except for its values 
We may therefore expect that even if another crisis comes this flexible giant will manage 
IBM History From Cheese Cutter To Space Travel
Flint hired a director of a competing company Thomas J Watson to help him with company management 
The leader then put the IBMs founder in the shade Watsons ideas remain the base for invincible company culture and identity 
IBM as its name suggests started by producing and selling various business machines from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers 
During the first four years of Watsons leadership the revenue doubled to nine million dollars and companys vast expansion into all continents commenced 
Watson became so essential for the company that after nearly forty years his position in the directors chair was taken by his son Thomas Watson Junior 
Under his leadership IBM started to develop artificial intelligence and created the first programming language 
Twenty years later IBM sold computer production to a Chinese company Lenovo While buying the consultant division of PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus commenced its full focus on consulting and high added value services 
In the past three years IBM has been highly successful with its Smarter Planet concept 
Its goal is both smart exploitation of technologies in areas that have not yet been planned for and improving the situation in traffic or town management 
For commerce IBM has recently introduced a Smarter Commerce platform that helps businessmen control the whole commerce cycle 
IBMs history is strong even in our country 
Today IBM CZ also runs a strategic outsourcing centre in Brno 
The headquarters for both Central and Eastern Europe resides in Prague where there also is a world level research team focusing on voice recognition 
Rychtov about her Unfaithful Husband 
Iveto keep the fool I dont want him anymore 
However she does not want to wait any longer and set clear rules for her future life 
When Darina Rychtov provided shelter for Bartoov in her house in summer she probably had not the slightest idea of what was going to happen to her marriage 
Moreover he publically admitted he loved her 
After some time Darina resigned pretended to accept her husbands affair and now she gave him her final goodbye 
Rychyt does not care who his wife sleeps with
Even if one day Rycht and Bartoov would split up his wife will not welcome him with open arms 
So far Josef does not mind that his wife closed the hind gate on him 
He claims that if Rychtov found a new love he would not stand in her way 
The Worst Feminine Habits Do They Concern You 
When you ask men to name some typical bad habits women have they usually come up with all of them in an instant 
Dear ladies do you recognise yourself in the lines to follow describing several womens habits that make the men see red 
Shopping
Does your other half complain you are addicted to shopping 
Do you need to buy at least one piece of clothing a week 
Do you like shopping in mass sales 
If so then your shopping may be seen as bad habit 
Some women recognise they should somewhat control their passion for shopping 
Still who of you could resist walking through clothes shops looking for well fitting clothes and then trying them all ideally in various colour versions in the changing rooms 
Shopping may be a hobby for a majority of women but for men it may become absolute hell 
Just remember how many times you have told your other half to wait for you outside 
Permanent Dissatisfaction
Do you find these sentences familiar 
You do 
Then you belong to the group of women obsessed by their appearance 
The stronger sex also agrees that the higher the frequency of such complaints the more annoying women are 
Order and Cleanliness First
It is like a never ending story 
Cleaning the windows vacuuming wiping the floors dusting scrubbing the bathtub at least twice a week 
Do you blame your partner for stepping onto the clean tiles in dirty shoes your children for messing up a clean sink and leaving fingerprints over the glass pane in the living room that was so difficult to clean 
This harmless desire for cleanliness may threaten your relationships as well as the entire family 
Bossing About
If you boss your partner around several times a day he may find it very annoying 
Naturally you mean well you just want everything to be perfect 
Maybe if men realised that women would not have to boss them around so much 
Gossiping
Some women love gossiping offending and plotting against others 
Women are focused on relationships which is why they like to discuss who where who with how and why 
Every now and then probably each of us releases a gossip here or there 
Lets be frank this is probably the nature all women 
However there are tougher gossips women who enjoy frequent gossiping and despise everyone They are especially within a female work team very dangerous for their surroundings 
Assists of Jgr and Vorek Helped Philadelphias Victory
In both cases Claude Giroux used the experience of a thirtynine year old star he added an extra pass and was announced best player of the match 
Two assists in the match also belonged to Jgrs teammate Jakub Vorek 
After the match Jgr told the overseas journalists he had predicted a great evening for Giroux 
A little bit later second score for the team bore Czech traces too 
The trailing Hurricanes Vorek won the puck and presented it to Maxim Talbot who scored between the circles 
A second before the first break a home player Patrick Dwyer narrowed the lead in a powerplay but the beginning of the second part was led by Flyers again 
Specifically by Giroux 
After assist with Jgr he scored the third goal consequently his shot was touched into a fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds 
Carolina made the match more dramatic with Tuomo Ruutu and Dwyers goal from a penalty shot making it a single goal difference 
Further complications were avoided by Matt Read who increased the difference to two points 
Its victory moved Philadelphia onto the top of the Eastern Conference 
Czech Montreal defenseman Jaroslav paek did not finish the match with Buffalo he left in the second period due to an upper body injury 
Tom Plekanec failed to score on one of their raids 
More than lost points the home trainer was sorry for high sick rate in the back as the match was finished with just five defenders 
As travelling to the West was strictly limited travel agencies of the time mostly sold tours to the socialist block countries 
For their holiday Czech tourists thus went to the sea to the German Democratic Republic Soviet Union Sochi Crimea near the Black Sea Bulgaria Romania both to the Black Sea and Hungary Balaton 
A great paradox of the socialistic period was that citizens of the socialist block ie Czechoslovaks too were not allowed free individual travel within the socialist countries 
If a Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel as an individual to for example the Soviet Union or Poland an invitation letter from the country was necessary otherwise individual travel was impossible 
Still that was not all 
A foreign currency assurance was essential for travels to the West It was not granted to politically unreliable people who were not allowed to travel at all 
Czechoslovakian currency was not freely convertible without the currency assurance it was not possible to obtain financial means Western currency for travelling West 
Most often Czechs spent their holiday at home which resulted in great number of cottages and summer houses a habit that survives until now 
Czechoslovaks could not get enough of travelling to the West Everyone wanted to go there for at least a moment 
For example in Paris Czech tours slept in parks in tents because their income at the time was not enough to pay for a hotel or a pension 
A typical feature of Czech tourism then was bringing their own food cans salami etc to save money 
Another important moment was the introduction of freely convertible Czech Crown After decades our tourists thus finally able to freely buy Western currencies 
Since then direct charter flights take Czech tourists to warm exotic countries This winter flights from the Czech Republic will reach twelve exotic destinations 
General Meeting Should Find a President Mate Threat Returns
For nearly five months Czech football has had no President There exists a risk that Ivan Haeks successor the head of Czech Republics Football Association FAR will not be known even after another extraordinary general meeting which is to take place in Nymburk on Thursday 
There is still no agreement as to which election rules to follow 
Without it voting for the three candidates will not start 
Jindich Rajchl Miroslav Pelta and Tom Paclk are eager to lead Czech football 
Haek resigned from his function in June When leaving he called to his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who would lead football in the future 
However Haeks era sees football back in quarrels between both association chambers unable to agree on a common candidate 
General meeting delegates wasted their trip to the National House in Prague Smchov as the negotiations remained blocked not just regarding the election method 
No agreement was reached as to who is entitled to vote at the general meeting whether the statutory representatives only or also officials given power of attorney 
This single point has been partially settled since thanks to a recommendation of the Institute of State and Law according to which representation based on power of attorney is not possible 
Arguments concerning the election rules continue though 
The Executive Board has not been of much help either though at its meetings both regular and extraordinary it is mostly preoccupied by this issue 
The view of election options has changed several times but the key point remains the same 
Moravia is said to accept a compromise to have a candidate with the highest percentage of total votes from both chambers win the election 
The Czech part stresses a condition that in the percentage total the winner must gain at least twothird superiority 
Somewhat surprisingly Tom Paclk agrees with his opinion even if it is estimated that the election rules defined by the bylaws fits Pelta best of the candidates 
aposI wish the elections follow the bylaws to the maximumapos
Pelta remains an optimist 
He believes the new President will be known in Nymburk he also hopes that in the future the candidates will cooperate constructively 
Rajchl is more reserved 
There is not much time left for an agreement between the parties 
Some negotiations are said to have taken place directly in Montenegro but who knows if the football generality will be complete before the match 
An extra flight that was to take among others the Vice Presidents Dalibor Kuera and Rajchl to Podgorica did not leave Prague in the morning due to a technical failure An alternative was sought for in order to transport part of the executive board to the scene of the barraged rematch 
Finally a meeting at ministry level said to happen on Wednesday may decide 
Minister of Education Youth and Sports Josef Dobe would like to force the split parties inside the strongest sports association in the country to reach an agreement 
A lot is in the game Government grants football trustworthiness and the planned STV general meeting dealing with new direction of Czech sports following Sazkas financial problems 
Paclk Enters the Presidential Fight As He Cannot See a Suitable Candidate
If before the extraordinary general meeting the Head of Pilsen football players Tom Paclk saw a strong candidate who would meet all of his expectations of a new Football Association of the Czech Republic FAR President he would not even apply for the top function 
Paclks motivation to join the fight with Miroslav Pelta and Jindich Rajchl is to try to prevent Pelta reportedly the favourite of the elections from entering the top of the FAR 
In the future he would like to see the position given to an experienced top manager not excessively connected to football life 
At the moment Paclks strongest disagreement with Pelta is based on the latters connection to Roman Berbr President of Pilsens regional football association Berber is a man of controversial reputation who is behind the scenes known as powerful lobbyist capable of influencing the votes of general meeting delegates 
Paclk therefore finds it unacceptable for Pelta to become the President 
He is hinting at the fact that some years ago Peltas name was recorded during phone tapping in a corruption affair investigation Pelta came out without a sentence 
In case Paclk wins on Thursday he could imagine cooperation with Pelta in the future 
This opinion is shared by another candidate Rajchl whom Paclk supported before the September general meeting that ended as a fiasco 
aposHe is very capableapos
aposBut he cannot manage the associationapos
Paclk claims he would dare to manage the association 
He refers to his skills from management of private companies since last summer he has been managing the Pilsen team that with his support celebrated its first league triumph in May 
One of his priorities would be the strengthening of relations between FAR and the Czech Olympic Committee with whose support he would lobby at the political top to get more money for sports from the lottery tax 
Paclk does not consider his connection with the Pilsen club a burden though he claims that an FAR President should be a nonparty one 
Pelta is connected to Jablonec and Rajchl to Prague Dukla 
Pelta Promised New FAR Regulations That Would Avoid Election Mate
Two days before the general meeting of the football association one of the Presidential candidates Miroslav Pelta promised that if he is elected he would strive for new FAR regulations to avoid future disputes over the election rules 
Before the Thursday negotiations in Nymburk a Jablonec functionary remains an optimist and believes that the preelection fight would be significantly suppressed by todays prospective success of our football representation 
Prior to the failed election in September Pelta promised that if he was to win he would focus on both the representation and gaining of financial means 
He decided to participate in the elections before the last general meeting at the last moment A twomonth delay thus could have been useful for him to defend his ideas concerning football management in wider context 
This gives him the reason to believe he is experienced enough to manage Czech football 
He believes current problems with elections are caused by the euphoria there was in the time of Ivan Haeks reign 
He approached the rewriting of the key document of the civil association as a decoy for the delegates 
Other than that he says he does not try to define himself against the rivals 
In the past he has already announced he can imagine his cooperation with Jindich Rajchl whom he recognises for his legal education he is well aware of the fact that his rival candidate should become his first Vice President 
For a long time he did not attack Tom Paclk who has constantly criticised Pelta 
He sees his strongest weapon in knowledge of football from the lowest competitions to representation 
The representation should be the shopping window of football 
He then promised that his arrival to the head of the football would not mean any personnel housecleaning 
Despite current catastrophic scenarios accompanying the general meeting planned he believes that on Thursday the delegates will not come to Nymburk in vain 
Rajchl Promises That under Him the FAR Will Start Working Hard
If on Thursdays general meeting Jindich Rajchl the existing Vice President is to become the President of Czech Football Association many people in the Association would reportedly not be pleased 
Rajchl promises that if he is elected hard work will come 
He wants to establish system changes and make members of the executive board responsible for individual football areas 
He also promised to solve the Bohemians case improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA bring more money to football and continue the work of the previous President Ivan Haek 
Critical atmosphere in football movement supposedly made him doubt his candidature 
Moreover he says his motivation is to continue the work he started with Haek 
Furthermore he refutes the allegations he would only be a Czech President 
As the Presidential fight has been joined by Pilsen club Manager Tom Paclk Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances to win 
On the other hand he considers the fact that the association does not stick together partially as his own fault 
While claiming that Pelta has been disqualified from returning trustworthiness to Czech football he considers the other rival Paclk a strong candidate that has things to offer 
Europes most beautiful pools
Leap into the water
By Julia Stanek
Paddling pools with universal fibre optics and status pools in Budapest Travellers can experience Europes incredible water and relax tired limbs in a Jacuzzi after a city tour or a ramble 
One book can tell you where the water is at its best 
There was one thing Iris Meder could not do without on research trips over the last one and a half years her swimming costume 
Lying back on the water she has looked up at artistically designed domes has swum towards marble cherubs awaiting her at the edge of the pool and has marvelled at meticulously restored art nouveau swimming pools 
She rushed to add any pool she liked to her notebook with essential details on the construction and the history of the building 
She has very little enthusiasm for sport says Meder but in the water its a different matter 
The only downside is that fans of swimming have to cope with blue glazed tiles and the stench of chlorine while joggers can breathe in the beguiling scent of spruce forests or listen to the bright twittering of birds in the park 
Water surface doubles architecture
Splashing in the diving pool and ethereal sauna oils the wellness factor in baths is so great because all the senses are stimulated according to Meder 
Everything is mirrored visually high ceilings colourful tiles and diving boards 
Pool collector Meder discovered some notable examples during research in Hungary 
Many of the heated outdoor baths in Switzerland and Austria on the other hand offer spectacular views You can view all of Zurich from a rooftop bath or look out on the snowcapped Arlberg from an outdoor pool in St Anton And there is a window in the steam bath giving a view of the action on the ski piste 
Perhaps the most unusual pool design awaits bathers in Lngenfeld The Aqua Dome in tztal looks like a UFO has just landed in the Alps 
It steams during the winter from three opentopped shells dwarfed by the tztal mountains behind it 
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Pool collector Meder was not greeted by the smell of chlorine in every swimming pool 
A lot of thermal baths smell of sulphur The rpd baths in Bkescsaba Hungary smell so strongly of oil you may find it difficult to believe you are in a health spa 
The smell comes from the hydrogen carbonate in the alkaline water The water is almost black with silt that sticks to the skin as soon as you slide into the pool a wellness experience of a particular kind 
Iris Meder however was at one point disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing places When she tried to visit the outdoor pool at the Czech baths of Luhatschowitz she found the area sealed off 
When Meder looked through the weatherbeaten windows of the red white and yellow art nouveau building she could see weeds growing up through the tiles 
One place where decay has been stopped in its tracks is a magical swimming bath in the Black Forest the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad 
A dip in the thermal pool in such a palace is clearly of secondary importance 
Agricultural commodities speculation
Deutsche Bank has commodity trading investigated
By Christian Teevs
Will Deutsche Bank stop trading agricultural commodities 
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE Josef Ackermann has given a working group the task of investigating the consequences of speculation for the poor around the world 
The CEO plans to make changes in January 
Hamburg 
Two thirds of those questioned demand that Deutsche Bank and other banks cease trading in agricultural commodities as trading deepens the problems faced by the very poorest people around the world 
The findings were made in a survey conducted by the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on behalf of the consumer organisation Foodwatch 
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in midOctober 
The author of the report Harald Schumann shows that betting on global commodities exchanges drives up prices and the banks are therefore complicit in global hunger 
The campaign by consumer advocates is directed specifically at the head of Deutsche Bank Josef Ackermann although large banking houses such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley trade in the same way 
Originally commodity betting was designed as a means of protecting traders against price fluctuations 
However most experts now agree that the gamblers have left behind the rules of supply and demand and are profiting at the expense of the poorest 
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE an international working group is currently investigating the accusations contained in the Foodwatch report 
The investigation should be complete by the end of the year when the findings will be presented to Deutsche Banks board of managing directors with recommendations for action 
The head of the bank then plans to announce changes following the investigation at the end of January 
Commodities trading may be reduced or stopped completely 
Ackermann working on his image
As top bank lobbyist Ackermann has a particular duty according to Bode 
Ackermanns sensitive response is at first surprising but then the CEO would like to present a perfect image just a few months before the end of his term in office 
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the chairman will not move to the supervisory board as had been planned 
Cancelling contentious food commodity speculation could improve his image 
He also need have little concern for the costs it would be up to his successor to manage the outcome 
One in two people would withdraw commodities investments
Foodwatch is striving to keep up the pressure on the manager 
No more than eleven percent think it is legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments that bet on the price of foodstuffs 
Many banking customers would also take direct action if they discover that their bank is involved in such trading According to the survey one in two would withdraw investments that end up in commodities speculation 
The relocated pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
Now it is being reopened as an exhibition centre 
The building is considered a milestone in contemporary architecture 
It made the architect so famous that he also built Austrias pavilion at the next worlds fair 
However the building was not suitable as a museum for technical and spatial reasons it had no walls to hang artworks and poor air conditioning 
Nonetheless it continued to be used until contemporary art in Vienna was given a new home 
The museum is a branch of the Belvedere museum which will open the first exhibition on Tuesday evening a delight in every respect 
HussleinArco an art history graduate with a remarkable career in her youth as an ice skater who went on to Sothebys the Guggenheim Museum and to become the founding director of the Museum der Moderne in Salzburg convinced politicians and conservators to go ahead with renovation attracted public funding and private sponsorship and decided on the use of the building 
The new museum was to house the Fritz Wotruba Foundations permanent collection a caf and a bookshop alongside contemporary art An office building was also to be built 
Strict supervision amp limited budget
Krischanitz was then the ideal choice to carry out the project 
He knew the original design and knew the issues the building was facing a building that had already lost some of its grandeur and lightness when it was relocated to Vienna and converted 
The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced fibreglassreinforced safety glass was put in and the glass roof was replaced by highgrade safety glass 
Thermal bridge steel girders were strengthened or replaced and asbestos was removed from ceilings 
Two lower floors created space for the new use of the building a sunken light well between the building and the street provides lighting a bridge leads to the entrance almost a new building but still the delicate Schwanzer pavilion 
The original external doors have been retained and the building has been painted in the old redbrown colour of rustproofing 
And the cinema hall is exactly as it used to be 
All this under the strict supervision of the monument authority and with a limited budget 
The building has remained flexible and light despite the constraints problems and conversions 
Deutsche Bahn plans winter crisis package into the millions
Deutsche Bahn has come up with a crisis plan to prevent train cancellations in the winter 
The number of employees is to double 
The costs will run into the millions 
Investment is intended to improve the availability of locomotives and the rail network even in the face of extreme weather conditions 
Rdiger Grube head of Deutsche Bahn warned of train cancellations and delays this winter at a summit with government and industry two months ago 
Last winter Deutsche Bahn had considerable difficulties in its passenger business as it lacked reserves in the face of difficult weather conditions 
Numerous new regional trains have been waiting for years for approval from the Federal Railway Office 
There is also some delay in the delivery of ICE trains 
Deutsche Bahn has also been forced to have the axles of ICE trains checked significantly more frequently for many years after an ICE trains axle broke in Colognes main station 
Deutsche Bank pays multimillion pound fine in the USA
Fresh trouble is following hard on the heels of the uproar around Josef Ackermann CEO of Deutsche Bank Deutsche Bank faces a multimillion pound fine in the USA 
The issue centres on the sale of mortgage securities 
The National Credit Union Administration NCUA a financial market regulator accuses a string of major banks of having used false promises to mislead credit unions into buying the financial products 
The value of the securities dropped dramatically during the financial crisis and brought down the credit unions 
The bank did not admit culpability in the settlement 
The NCUA chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the responsiveness of the two banks 
The National Credit Union Administration NCUA is responsible for the US credit unions and intervenes in bankruptcies to protect customer deposits 
The NCUA is fighting for compensation for losses that run into the billions 
The current settlements are the first of their kind 
The regulator had also approached other major banks and sued JPMorgan Chase the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer 
The dubious mortgage securities are socalled mortgagebacked securities 
They are underpinned by home loans 
The banks battling against a strong wind in the USA several years later 
Investors and regulators have brought a vast number of claims for compensation or to punish misconduct 
The Federal Housing Finance Agency FHFA has been behind the largest wave of claims 
Deutsche Bank has rejected the claims as baseless and has declared its intention to fend off the claims 
Financial guru Buffett is investing heavily in the IT company IBM 
Since March he has bought up shares totalling more than ten billion dollars 
Until now the major American investor Warren Buffett had always claimed not to invest in IT and computing companies as it was difficult to forecast the longterm development 
However IBMs annual reports changed his mind on investing in the industry 
According to Buffett he should have realised much earlier that IBM primarily offers services and purchases computer systems for the IT departments of other companies 
Investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knighthood in the financial world 
Buffett said that even IBM knew nothing of his involvement until recently 
He praised the management which has managed to bring in profits even during the economic crisis 
For a fairly long time IBM has focused on lucrative IT services such as data centres 
Buffett had avoided technology firms to date 
He claimed only to invest in companies whose business he understands
and invested in a freight railway for example a lubricant manufacturer and a machine manufacturer 
His lifestyle however has remained humble 
making him a cult figure for countless investors around the world 
The IBM share price rose by one percent before the markets opened following the announcement of Buffetts investment 
Buffett however has said he is not planning to invest in Microsoft 
The founder Bill Gates is a close friend 
Imminent danger
Fear and concern has been the reaction to this report in Turkey and within the GermanTurkish community in Germany 
There was never any question however that xenophobia does exist in Germany 
The rightwing extremist network that has now been discovered however is on a scale that has not yet been fully understood 
The Sabah newspaper on the other hand points out that one of the perpetrators was a confidential informant for the intelligence services and expresses concern that the German authorities may be caught up in the rightwing extremist quagmire 
The Turkish Community of Germany TGD reacted calmly remembering the victims of racial violence during a silent vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate at the weekend 
Just two weeks earlier the Turkish Community in Berlin had commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the GermanTurkish bilateral agreement on labour recruitment in a ceremony with German and Turkish politicians 
Cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light as a success story 
The German edition of Hrriyet also does not miss the chance to make this connection 
He points out that people have been murdered who had paid taxes and made an important contribution to Germanys redevelopment with their work 
The behaviour of the police and the subsequently successful manhunt is heavily criticised on GermanTurkish internet forums 
The authors are asking themselves why the German authorities did not think earlier to look for suspects in rightwing extremist circles 
The photo of the burnt out ruin of Solingen is deeply engrained in German and Turkish memory 
No other event has shown the Turks living here more clearly that there is imminent danger and shown the Germans that mistrust and distance can culminate in real violence 
The attacks however increased the sense of Turkish unity 
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press at the time complained mainly of the failure of German policy following the attacks Helmut Kohl declined to visit the survivors in Mlln 
He sent a telegram of commiseration to the Turkish president after the arson attack in Solingen but it was his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel who took his place at the memorial ceremony in Cologne Kinkel summed up in his speech the taxes Turks contribute in Germany 
just as if he were calculating the value of a person by the taxes he pays 
The coverage by the Turkish media at the time again shows how deep the mistrust of many German Turks in the current German state has become since 
Straight talking is what is needed now alongside efforts to identify and reassess rightwing extremist terrorism in Germany 
The Lake Zurich banking scandal
The most risktaking bank in Europe is not in Italy or France but in Switzerland 
UBS almost went bankrupt during the financial crisis and has been struggling from one crisis to the next ever since 
A German is now to bring it back in line 
Axel Weber certainly had not imagined that would be his role 
Axel Weber was clearly delighted praising Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly won solidity and making some friendly remarks about his future colleagues 
But by September it was already clear that everything would be very different 
UBS CEO Oswald Grbel a banker not only famous in Switzerland had to go 
The UBS Chairman has been considered ailing ever since and everyone is asking when will Axel Weber finally arrive 
That will be tough for Axel Weber 
He is an economics professor and central banker not a conventional banker and clearly would need some time to adjust 
UBS is both huge it was the biggest asset manager in the world until recently and has been struggling from one scandal to the next for years 
The proud Swiss bank it seems is to be spared nothing 
It began in the financial crisis 
The bank combined the image of the secretive and solid but equally savvy asset manager with ambitious targets aiming to become a major player in investment banking 
and had risen to the league of the worlds biggest banks as an investment bank 
That made an impression 
He was very wrong indeed 
In the middle of the year CEO Peter Wuffli considered a highly intellectual and equally brilliant banker suddenly stepped down 
Some months later we could guess at why he had left 
The investment division of the bank had gambled on subprime securities and was forced to write off billions 
The bank actually managed to find investors but investors many bankers would have respectfully declined a short while earlier a less than transparent Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and an Arabic sovereign wealth fund that was so secretive even its name was not disclosed 
That was just the first blow 
The National Bank bought up toxic securities from UBS for untold billions and the Swiss Confederation paid six billion Swiss francs for a mandatory convertible bond to become part owner of the bank 
The whole of Switzerland was shocked the country recognised the dramatic consequences for a small country of being home to such large banks 
The second catastrophe followed closely on the heels of the first 
A few months later UBS capitulated in the tax dispute with the USA and declared that it was prepared to hand over the data of wealthy clients who had potentially avoided paying tax with the help of the bank 
UBS therefore more or less admitted having been an accessory to tax evasion 
At the same time UBS lost something that had always been its advantage when competing for rich clients the fog of secrecy 
Swiss banking secrecy was not the same after the scandal 
The CEO and the Chairman then resigned and
the exodus of client money began 
The bank had lost its credibility in both of its core business divisions within a few months in investment banking thanks to bad speculation and in asset management by aiding and abetting tax evasion 
One thing is clear risk management in the investment banking division is still not working 
It was precisely the concept of caution that had long ago made Swiss bankers the guardians of the worlds major assets no excessive risk but security for money whether the world fell apart outside the Alpine republic or not 
The safes of Swiss banks had become a symbol of unshakeable reliability just as Lindt and Sprngli had come to symbolise sophisticated chocolate 
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still fit the clich of the dignified Swiss private bank just a bit bigger 
The location alone is classic 
The bank has its head office on Zurichs Bahnhofstrasse that leads from the main station directly to Zurich Lake surrounded by the snowcapped peaks of the Swiss mountains 
The buildings are ostentatious and the shop rates are among the highest in Europe 
Jewellers such as Tiffanys are to be found here between traditional Swiss shops such as Confiserie Sprngli 
The Swiss banks have resided here for hundreds of years from the National Bank to the palace of Credit Suisse and elite private banks such as Julius Br 
A heavy revolving door opens onto the UBS reception 
UBS knows that its clients are looking for security 
But both the major Swiss banks UBS and Credit Suisse at some point ousted the Swiss banking concept or betrayed it as the head of one small Swiss private bank believes 
He would prefer not to see his name in the newspaper he too like all Swiss bankers does business with the two major banks 
He believes UBS has grown too big particularly in investment banking where the AngloSaxons are also very active 
In his opinion the Swiss have nothing to add 
It was in fact AngloSaxon investment banking that changed UBS brought in its first big profits and then the debacle No other European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the major Swiss bank 
How could it have come to that 
Talking to Swiss banks they see the issue mainly in the size of UBS 
A bank was created that was already too big for small Switzerland when the merger was agreed and a bank that continued to grow 
The fact that the two banks that went to form UBS complemented each other helped One was a wealthy but sedate bank specialising in asset management in Zurich and the other was less wealthy but much more internationalised 
The internationalised investment bankers suddenly had access to a lot of money that they could use to turn an almighty wheel 
But Ospel in the end relied on Wuffli 
Tragic it may be 
Pride comes before a fall 
Employees of UBS clearly remember the management meetings where CEO Wuffli always repeated the same slogan dethrone Goldman Sachs 
The American bank was the worlds most powerful investment bank 
UBS wanted to get to the very top of the league 
It managed some of the way 
UBS was a major player in foreign exchange and stocks 
UBS had gaps in its US mortgage products 
To plug the hole UBS entered on an adventure that almost cost it its existence 
Hungry for growth the bank itself and a hedge fund founded by the bank invested in US subprime securities 
It developed into a vast machine that packaged up securities based on US mortgage credit and passed them on while itself continuing to bear risks 
Even when other banks had long been looking for a way out UBS carried on 
The greater the rise the greater the fall 
One manager after the next had to go as the attempts to clean up proved more difficult than anticipated 
Posts at UBS became a game of musical chairs and remain uncertain to this day 
Any head of the major bank now has an almost impossible job 
He must find a strategy for a bank that has turned its back on all existing business models 
Banking expert Geiger already has an idea quit investment banking focus on asset management and turn back to Swiss roots 
The bank however is not yet prepared to go that far 
It is clear nonetheless that investment banking must shrink significantly 
The new head of the bank Sergio Ermotti plans to present his future strategy to the world on Tuesday 
Since then he has proved his mettle and is now to head UBS permanently the Zurichbased bank announced on Tuesday 
But that will not be enough 
UBS needs a vision 
What is UBS 
How does it plan to make money 
Those are the questions Axel Weber is definitely already asking himself 
Publicly he has only so far that he and his wife will look for a flat in Zurich 
Next year 
Fear of recession in Europe depresses US stock exchange
The impending recession in Europe has depressed the mood of US investors at the start of the week 
The change of government in Athens and Rome had little impact 
Curbed industrial production on the continent nipped hopes that the debt crisis might stabilise in the bud 
The general relief following the change of government in Rome and Athens was not sustained 
The Euro fell against the dollar 
The Italian and Greek glass was still considered half full last week not half empty now the problems are coming to the fore once again said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott 
Financial stocks in particular were on the sales receipts 
The Eurostat statistics office announced that in September companies produced two percent less than in the previous month 
He also claimed that Europe is not likely to shake off a recession quickly and that there are further signs of weakness in the banks 
The investment legend Warren Buffett could only support such caution In a CNBC interview he said that it was not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do all that is needed to end the crisis 
In his opinion it is therefore too early to invest in European government bonds or banks 
Instead Buffett threw a decadesold principle out of the window to invest in the US technology industry 
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM boosted the veteran companys share price by almost one percent against the trend during the course of trading

Intelligent crows are spreading in cities
Rooks are considered problem birds in many places Experts now say the highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven from cities 
Some like the birds others would like to get rid of them as fast as possible Crows have been part of the cityscape for hundreds of years but residents complaining about the filth and noise the animals create are increasing in number in many communities 
A solution to the problem birds however is far from within reach 
Experts at the first crow symposium in the East Frisian town of Leer have said that rooks can no longer be forced out of cities 
Specialists from all over Germany discussed possible solutions 
Looking for alternatives in the cities
Conservationists stated that migration of specially protected rooks was the root of the problem in cities pointing out that the use of chemicals in agriculture was increasingly destroying traditional habitats 
Hunting increasing development and felling of typical breeding trees was making life hard for the birds 
Crows are protected 
Critics described the capture of the birds in bird traps and how they were beaten to death with clubs as particularly brutal 
Spraying off nests with water or felling trees often has undesired consequences said environment expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in BadenWrttemberg 
Deterrence would only be conceivable as an exception in hospitals retirement homes and schools 
Without the surrounding area the problem in the cities will not be solved said Leers mayor Wolfgang Kellner 
A combination of deterring birds from sensitive residential areas and offering incentives for them to move back to other areas would be an option 
Jrgens was a cofounder of the Ascherberg crow educational trail in SchleswigHolstein where notice boards provide information about the life of the highly intelligent rook 
The project is already attracting interest from tourists 
The intelligence and skill of the birds are legendary Rooks often do not just use tools to get hold of a choice morsel but create tools themselves 
In one experiment the birds quickly learnt that they had to knock over a platform to get to a moth larva 
They recognised the size and shape of stone needed to collapse the platform without much training 
In a second experiment the canny crows had to solve a trickier problem 
The researchers put a small bucket with a moth larva in a vertical cylinder 
The birds could not reach their prey with their beaks 
However the researchers had provided pieces of wire 
All four birds used the wire to form a hook and used the hook to fish the bucket out of the tube by its handle 
Three of the four rooks even managed it at the first attempt

Mass Slaughter on a Personal Level
Here is advice for proceeding Gently excise this page and make it your bookmark 
You will be getting to know these people very well in Mr Englunds novelistic telling and this dramatis personae will function as your GPS a beacon during those few moments when like one of his men and women you are confused and bereft in the fog of war 
Mr Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist 
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature 
It contains few big names major treaties or famous battles there are almost no ambassadors dashing journalists or discussions of tactics and materiel 
A few of these people will become heroes 
A few will become prisoners of war or lose limbs go mad or die 
Their lives flicker here like votive candles lighted in a church new ones are added to the mix while some wink out 
Mr Englunds book is a deviation from standard history books 
It is a corrective too to the notion that World War I was only about the dire trench warfare on the Western Front 
Soldiers in this book have beehives fall on them one has Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids tsetse flies are an intractable problem 
This is a moving book almost from the start 
War floods these peoples lives like a natural catastrophe a Hurricane Katrina that reeks of cordite 
When cannon fire is heard in the distance and you are a woman at home with your children do you stay or flee 
Who is coming anyway 
Almost no one understands whats happening even why this war is to be fought 
Their stories are mostly taken from memoirs letters and other already published material 
The accounts of their lives can be terrifying or stirring but are most fully alive in Mr Englunds accumulation of small moments stray details 
Many of these are about deprivation and making do 
He goes on about the ersatz food in Germany 
Some stories are about honor and bravery 
Conversely a British soldier realizes that he will most likely die and that no one will notice or care 
Other observations are about an old Europe falling away and about new types of terror 
People behave in unanticipated ways there is as much base behavior as heroism 
Mr Englund discussed the soldiers who actively tried to catch a venereal disease from prostitutes as a way to evade service at the front 
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves Mr Englunds prose is supple but unshowy perfectly suited to his humane task 
People begin to ask why their leaders are making them fight 
Mr Englunds volume joins an unconventional pantheon 
His book has the most devastating ending I can remember in a piece of nonfiction 
I wont give it away 
But its as if he has reached from his book snatched that dramatis personae page from your fingers and lighted it with a match 
After an Earlier Misstep a Minutely Planned Raid
Hundreds of police officers were involved some of them wearing riot helmets 
The overnight hours of Monday into Tuesday were chosen because Zuccotti Park would be at its emptiest 
The operation was kept secret from all but a few highranking officers with others initially being told that they were embarking on an exercise 
Police Commissioner Raymond W Kelly was at the center his presence underscoring how the operation was fraught with challenges for the Police Department 
There could be no repeat of episodes in recent weeks like the pepperspraying of protesters that violated department rules and created a firestorm of public sympathy for the squatters 
And so the police operation to clear Zuccotti Park of protesters unfolded after two weeks of planning and training 
Officials had prepared by watching how occupations in other cities played out 
A major disaster drill was held on Randalls Island with an eye toward Zuccotti 
Officials increased socalled disorder training counterterrorism measures that involve moving large numbers of police officers quickly to focus on Lower Manhattan 
The last training session was on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River 
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson learned by the city 
The operation on Tuesday involved officers from various police units including boroughwide task forces scores of mobile officers who are usually used to flood highcrime neighborhoods 
Emergency Service Unit trucks with klieg lights and loudspeakers gathered at Pike Slip and the Franklin D Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge before moving out 
The lights and prerecorded messages booming from the loudspeakers seemed to cow many protesters 
As the community affairs officers moved into the park in their lightblue windbreakers many protesters simply gathered their belongings and left 
Other teams of officers were seen gathering on the perimeter to move in if arrests were needed in the park 
Reporters in the park were forced to leave 
Paul J Browne the Police Departments chief spokesman said it was for their safety 
But many journalists said that they had been prevented from seeing the police take action in the park and that they had been roughly handled by officers 
Mr Browne said television camera trucks on Church Street along the parks western border were able to capture images 
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out the images appearing on the Internet soon after 
A core group of protesters took up positions close to the encampments kitchen area near the center of the park 
Some made a barrier and the police moved in to methodically arrest them 
And two people chained themselves to trees Mr Kelly said 
Emergency service officers were called in to cut the locks 
The highestranking officer on the scene was Joseph J Esposito the chief of department the top uniformed officer in the department 
Phil T Pulaski the departments chief of detectives was also there 
A second group of officers waited along the eastern side of Broadway between Liberty and Cedar Streets in case they had to move in 
Barricades were set up at Cortlandt Street a block north of the park and at Pine Street a block south 
From those positions the police were seen expanding the perimeter even farther outward from Zuccotti Park 
At one point several officers many with shields were seen pushing people farther out 
Some of the rowdiest action of the night took place south of the park 
At one point a piece of plywood came flying from the crowd 
In the end one officer and one protester were hospitalized 
Support Workers Union Will Sue City Over Layoffs
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday claiming the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools that serve poor students 
City officials have categorically denied that accusation 
At a City Council hearing last month Schools Chancellor Dennis M Walcott said the layoffs were a part of the budget they signed off on in June 
One council member fired back telling him that nothing in the budget specified that school support staff members would be laid off 
The suit will list Mr Walcott and the citys Department of Education as defendants and counts eight laidoff workers as plaintiffs all of them black or Latino women as were most of the aides who lost their jobs 
Elizabeth Thomas a spokeswoman for the citys Law Department said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations 
According to a draft of the complaint obtained by The New York Times the union has zeroed in on the number of layoffs at schools in poor parts of the city to support a claim of inequitable treatment saying poor schools lost more aides because they had been chronically underfinanced 
The union also claims that high school principals may have been misled by the language in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parent coordinators 
Mission over Congress ready to agree on Libya
It finally looks like Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are ready to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya 
All it took was for the revolt to succeed longtime dictator Moammar Gaddafi to be captured and killed and American involvement to end 
The language may sound innocuous but nothing about the Libya debate has been easy so far 
This summer lawmakers from both parties squabbled with each other and the White House over the wording of a series of resolutions to approve or disapprove of the US militarys role in the NATO mission in Libya 
In June Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of US military forces in Libya 
The bill was defeated in the House by a wide bipartisan margin and it never came up for a vote in the Senate 
But on the same day that bill failed in the House the chamber also voted down a measure that would have cut funding for American operations in Libya 
That left the US mission in a form of legislative purgatory with Congress upset enough to criticize Obamas handling of the mission but not so angry as to actually pull the rug out from under it 
Then Congresss indecision was overtaken by events 
Now the Senate may be ready to act 
Will the new measure earn the full support of the Foreign Relations panel or will it split lawmakers like the June bill did 
The last version was opposed by Sen Richard G Lugar Ind the committees top Republican 
Lugars spokesman said Monday that he had not seen the final version of the new bill yet 
Across the Capitol the House is to vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget a top legislative priority of nearly every congressional Republican and some Democrats 
The measure sponsored by Rep Bob Goodlatte RVa will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other topic to actually get a floor vote in the House or Senate this Congress 
Other lawmakers have been unsuccessful so far in bringing their amendments to the floor but not for lack of trying 
Some are duplicates the same bill offered in both the House and Senate and others are slight variations on each other 
The Budget Control Act which passed in August required that both the House and Senate vote on a balanced budget amendment 
Beyond the budget several members want to limit the number of terms members of Congress can serve while Rep Jos E Serrano DNY wants to lift the twoterm limit for presidents 
Rep Jesse L Jackson Jr DIll has offered a host of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care among other subjects 
An amendment prohibiting samesex marriage is a perennial offering as is one prohibiting flagburning 
Some lawmakers also want to allow for the nullification of federal laws if they are opposed by twothirds of the states 
As eager as members have been to offer amendments theyre not moving at any faster pace than in past years 
But they werent much more successful then than they are now 
The show documented her difficult journey back from the damage inflicted by a bullet that fractured her skull and pierced the left side of her brain passing from the front to the back of her head

Troops feel more pity than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City 
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness frustration and loss 
On cue several hundred soldiers sailors airmen and Marines strode into position around him 
The blacktie crowd rose to its feet and cheered 
Im sure the organizers meant well 
I know they did 
But it wasnt respect really It was pity 
The starkly conflicting impressions illustrate the uneasy relationship that has taken hold between the military and an often distant sometimes adoring American public 
The troops are lavished with praise for their sacrifices 
But the praise comes with a price service members say 
The public increasingly acts as if it feels sorry for those in uniform 
The topic is a sensitive one for military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve 
They also realize that the anger that returning troops faced in the latter years of the Vietnam War was far worse 
As a result most of the conversations about pity take place quietly and privately among combat veterans 
After his two sons returned from combat tours with the Marines retired Col Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military would view their service from two perspectives 
Some would look at them with a sense of awe because they faced down insurgents and traveled to exotic places 
During his job search he said he sensed that some interviewers had subtly inquired whether he would be able to hold up under the strain of a demanding Washington job immediately after his combat tour 
The militarys unease springs in part from American indifference to the wars 
Battlefield achievements are rarely singled out for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees little direct benefit from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars 
Instead praise from politicians and the public focuses largely on the depth of a service members suffering 
Troops are recognized for the number of tours they have endured the number of friends they have lost or the extent of their injuries 
Military Faces Mounting Pressure to Crack Down on Rape
If not hundreds of plaintiffs are lining up for the next one 
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink 
But the Texas native brushed aside her concern 
Within minutes of entering Lymans room the man came up from behind her throwing her down and raping her she alleges 
Burke says she is going after the militarys top brass because the problem begins with them 
Her strategy rather than piling all the plaintiffs into this case putting all her eggs in one basket so to speak she will file multiple cases if need be to keep the pressure on 
The defense team for the Department of Defense led by United States Attorney Neil MacBride has filed a motion to dismiss the case 
The court papers obtained by Newsweek detail the defense strategy essentially that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries incurred in the armed forces 
The Department of Defense declined to comment for this story 
While women are still officially prohibited from serving in combat that distinction is in name only modern wars rarely have clear front lines 
In both Iraq and Afghanistan teams of female soldiers are playing increasingly important roles especially in reaching out to local women in war zones 
Its time for the military to modernize as well Burke says 
She isnt alone in her fight three other lawsuits are under way in addition to hers 
Her group filed a suit in December against the Veterans Administration charging it with discriminatory practices in the way it handles benefit claims for people who say they were sexually assaulted in the service 
Nine separate bills have been introduced in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives proposing a range of fixes 
The plaintiffs in Burkes case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of traumas 
In Lymans case she reported the alleged rape to military police less than an hour after it occurred 
She did a rape kit and her assailants blood from a cut on his arm was found in her bed 
Six people testified as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator who was eventually acquitted 
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder rendering her unfit for service 
As for whether the case filed by Lyman and her fellow plaintiffs moves forward its a long shot says John Turley professor of law at George Washington University Law School 
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first issued 
Ive been a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine 
The military is decades behind because they dont have the same incentive and deterrent posed by liability 
These things only change when good people are willing to fight 
Or until we die whichever comes first 
Walls Have Eyes How Researchers Are Studying You on Facebook
Before he became the new face of rightwing extremism in Europe Anders Behring Breivik was just another guy airing his antiimmigration views online 
While Breivik may have acted alone he was far from alone in cyberspace he had spent much of the time leading up to his attack at his computer chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support rightwing groups on socialnetworking sites 
After this summers tragedy researchers wanted to find out more about these people 
But how to find them 
Easy just log on to Facebook 
Facebooks stash of personal information is so encyclopedic says Bartlett that the researchers could simply use the sites advertising tool to pinpoint their desired demographic with scientific accuracy the way marketers have been doing for years 
Bartletts team found half a million fans of rightwing groups across Europe and then targeted them with ads but instead of linking to a new band or diet product the ads invited users to complete a survey that asked questions about their education level attitudes towards violence and optimism about their own future 
Some of the results arent all that surprising online supporters of rightwing groups tend to be young male and vexed by immigration 
DEMOSs work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a hot new tool in the hands of scientists 
Think tanks medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health issues to social trends as expressed in Likes wall posts and status updates 
For some researchers the beauty of Facebook is that it lets you study people you couldnt approach with a clipboard on the street 
Others say the site could offer a way to identify and tackle socialhealth problems 
A recent study by Dr Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin Madison and her colleagues found that undergraduates who discussed their drunken exploits on Facebook were significantly more at risk for problem drinking than students who were silent on the topic 
Moreno suggests that students peers such as residential advisors could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who posts one too many boozy status updates 
Facebook too is constantly tapping into its own population for data 
But Facebooks users know the site is watching them whether they like it or not the trade off for being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is allowing the site to mine your personal information 
But what about when Facebook users become part of a survey they dont even know about 
While researchers have welldefined guidelines about how they collect their data offline online its a freeforall 
Then theres the question of methodology 
Even offline theres no guarantee that a research subject is being completely honest 
On Facebook its impossible to know how much of a users profile information and wall posts are true 
Which is why despite his years as a technology researcher Selwyn thinks a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use 
For the same reason he refused to allow Breivik who brought a prewritten speech with him to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing 
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye others to confirm that he is being held under lock and key 
All attended with the goal of moving toward closure 
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered and exited the building 
But that doesnt automatically ease the grief and confusion that an entire nation still feels 
But what Apple fans might find most revealing in a recently rediscovered Jobs interview dusted off in advance of special movie screenings in major markets this week is how much this creative mind understood about business processes and product workflows 
While a small portion of Cringelys interview was used in Nerds he says that the interviews master copies went missing in shipping 
For someone known to loathe indepth interviews Jobs seems surprisingly eager here to expound on his technological philosophies and business strategies 
And incredibly thoughtful 
Filmed before the era of Pixar the iPod or the iPhone theres something eerily prescient about the Lost Interview as Jobs assesses what he sees other companies doing right and wrong and offers his own vision of the future of computing 
He has a vision for the way things could be and should be 
Not long after spelling it all out here he went and did it 
A quick rundown of seven notable Lost Interview sequences 
On how he learned to run a business 
Nobody knows why they do what they do nobody thinks about things very deeply in business 
Thats what I found 
Jobs goes on to detail his efforts to streamline accounting at Apple 
On pranking the Pope 
He describes how he and Wozniak would test the box by using a pay phone placing a call and then connecting from one AT amp T network to another while looping in as many satellites as possible 
Us two we didnt know much but we could build a little thing that could control a giant thing it was an incredible lesson and I dont think there would have ever been Apple without it 
Jobs goes on to detail one glorious prank that he and Wozniak nearly pulled of ringing the Vatican via the Blue Box in the middle of the night and requesting to speak to the Pope while doing their very best impression of Henry Kissinger 
As various members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat the two burst into giggles just before the Pope himself was roused to come answer the phone 
On falling in love with technology and coldcalling Bill Hewlett 
It was as big as a suitcase had a small cathode ray tube display and I fell in love with it 
I would get a ride up to HP as a teenager and hang around that machine and write programs for it 
On improvising innovation 
At several points in the interview Jobs talks about inventing new products on the fly 
Early in his career as he set out to sell a handful of circuit boards he was asked by a customer to assemble the full computer 
Later while at Apple he recalls the struggles he faced in developing a computer mouse 
On great companies losing steam 
Long before he led the revival of Apple Jobs presciently foresaw the ways in which so many industry leaders would stumble in their vision and lose control of their market share 
You have a monopoly of the market share so the companys not more successful 
The product genius that led to that monopolistic position is rotted out by people who have no conception of good products vs bad products the craftsmanship required 
Thats what happened at Xerox 
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry 
They grabbed defeat from victory 
On innovation as art form 
You learn a lot about the subtleties of it 
There are tradeoffs you have to make certain things you cant make electrons do glass do robots do factories do 
Ultimately it comes down to taste it comes down to trying to expose yourself to the best stuff humans have done and then trying to bring those things in to what youre doing 
Picasso said that good artists copy great artists steal 
Weve always been shameless about stealing great ideas 
Its part of what made the Macintosh great was that the people who were working on it were musicians poets artists zoologists historians who just happened to be the best computer scientists in the world 
If not for computer science they would be doing amazing things in other fields 
Scalia and Thomas dine with healthcare law challengers as court takes case
The day the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to consider the politically divisive question of whether it would hear a challenge to President Obamas healthcare law two of its justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas were feted at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will argue the case before the high court 
The occasion was last Thursday when all nine justices met for a conference to pour over the petitions for review 
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue that the law should be thrown out is likely to be Paul Clement who served as US solicitor general during the George W Bush administration 
Clements law firm Bancroft PLLC was one of almost two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society a longstanding group dedicated to advocating conservative legal principles 
Another firm that sponsored the dinner Jones Day represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law the National Federation of Independent Business 
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc which has an enormous financial stake in the outcome of the litigation 
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel hours after the courts conference over the case 
In attendance was among others Mitch McConnell the Senates top Republican and an avowed opponent of the healthcare law 
The featured guests at the dinner Scalia and Thomas 
Its nothing new The two justices have been attending Federalist Society events for years 
And its nothing that runs afoul of ethics rules 
In fact justices are exempt from the Code of Conduct that governs the actions of lower federal justices 
Nevertheless the sheer proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case as well as to a company with a massive financial interest was enough to alarm ethicsingovernment activists 
Their appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undercuts any claims of impartiality and is unacceptable 
Scalia and Thomas have shown little regard for critics who say they too readily mix the business of the court with agendadriven groups such as the Federalist Society 
Moreover conservatives argue that its Justice Elena Kagan who has an ethical issue not Scalia and Thomas 
Kagan served as solicitor general in the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were brought at the trial court level 
Her critics have pushed for Kagan to recuse herself from hearing the case saying that she was too invested in defending the law then to be impartial now 
Kagan has given no indication she will do so 
Just as big is where Boeing got the order the Middle East a growing gold mine of future airplane orders 
The blockbuster order came from Emirates airline in Dubai 
Many Middle East airlines are owned by their oilproducing nations 
So not only do they have the money to pay for planes but a surge in fuel prices usually damaging to airlines because its one of their biggest costs is not as detrimental because the country is making money on the higher price of oil 
Thats important because they will be less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay airplane orders when fuel prices rise Dihora said

Mexico presidents sister apparently defeated in Michoacan vote
Luisa Maria Calderon alleges that drug traffickers helped opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the governors race 
President Felipe Calderons sister appears to have lost her bid for governor of Michoacan during violent state elections and she alleged Monday that drug traffickers helped tip the race in favor of one of her opponents 
Preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the western state to Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party or PRI 
But it is staging a comeback and victory in Michoacan is an important step in that effort 
The PRI is hoping to win the presidential election in July 
Vallejo appears to have only narrowly edged out Calderon who had led polls before election day 
Calderon a candidate for her brothers conservative National Action Party or PAN refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner 
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results 
Vallejo former mayor of the state capital of Morelia denied ties to drug traffickers and urged the other candidates to accept the results 
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana heroin and methamphetamines 
Yet violence has persisted 
A PAN mayor was assassinated a week before the election as he campaigned for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates quit local races out of fear 
For the PRI though however nasty the Michoacan election looks a win will help the partys momentum 
ADB urges Asia to help rescue eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has called for India and China to be ready to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a longterm downturn that will stunt the growth of Asian economies 
Europes monetary union has been badly undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in past months 
In recent days Italys borrowing costs have soared dangerously and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned 
The unfolding sovereign debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that it could push the global economy back into recession and prompted calls for leading emerging economies to band together to help the eurozone find a solution 
Mr Nag predicted that any Asian support would be channelled through the IMF but said bilateral assistance like buying the bonds of the EUs bailout fund the European financial stability facility offered greater bargaining power to Europes Asian partners 
Others argue that developing economies like India have no business helping wealthy Europeans when they face their own profound economic challenges 
Lee Howell the managing director of the World Economic Forum likewise questioned why Indias reserves should be used to keep Greeces numerous and wellpaid public sector workers in jobs in poorly managed lossmaking utilities like the railways 
Dire warnings from Pentagon over potential defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta turned up the heat on Congress Monday warning that looming automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and set off a financial chain reaction from the hallways of the Pentagon to the battlefields of Afghanistan to civilian assembly lines 
The cuts would eventually hit combat troops Panetta said 
Whether the Panetta letter and the fresh warnings from Senators will increase pressure for a budget compromise or step up calls to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen 
Panetta has been increasingly outspoken about the possible cuts although he came to the top Pentagon job with years of budget expertise himself in Congress and the White House and knowing that he was facing tough choices 
At a news conference last week the secretary of defense painted a bleak picture of what could lie ahead a military with a shell but no core 
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could face the ax including those already being tested and some just in early stages of planning 
How to spot a lie
A glance at recent headlines indicates just how serious and pervasive deceit and lying are in daily life 
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy trading allegations of sexual harassment with several women each side accuses the other of lying 
Administrators at Penn State have been charged with perjury for allegedly covering up reports that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting boys 
Last week French president Nicolas Sarkozy was caught on an open microphone asserting to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar 
Lying has destroyed careers and convulsed countries 
New York congressman and Internet flasher Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself issuing denials quickly contradicted by incontrovertible evidence 
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign finance violations connected to the coverup of an extramarital affair 
And then again no one who lived through it will ever forget the media circus President Bill Clinton unleashed by lying during his second term in office about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky 
Tales of cheating on school and college tests are rife 
There have been instances where teachers have given students test answers in order to make themselves look good on their performance reviews 
Mentors who should be teaching the opposite are sending a message that lying and cheating are acceptable 
How much deceit do we encounter 
Now granted many of those are white lies 
One result of the research is that most old myths about lying have been debunked 
Liars do look you in the eye 
They do not always stutter stammer blush or fidget 
Dont conclude from this that liars are hard to spot and difficult to unmask 
A trained lie spotter can get to the truth by learning about statement structure facial microexpressions question formation and timing 
I spent several years surveying the scientific findings in the vast and ever emerging body of knowledge on deception and it is clear that deception detection is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helpful in navigating our complex world especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring interviewing negotiating or managing 
Good liars are skilled at reading others well putting them at ease managing their own emotions and intuitively sensing how others perceive them 
We also know that if you are perceived as a wrongdoer others will feel less guilt in lying to you 
How do you tell if someone is lying 
First observe your subjects normal behavior 
It helps provide a reference point for measuring changes later 
Observe your subjects posture laugh vocal quality 
Youd better know if someone normally taps their foot all the time so you dont make unjust accusations when you see foottapping in the middle of the meeting 
Then look for clusters of deceptive verbal and nonverbal behaviors 
Consider these clusters red flags not proof of deception 
Interrogators often falsely signal that an interview is over just to look for that postinterview relief 
Also pay attention to your subjects language 
Scott Peterson famously slipped and used the past tense while claiming his murdered wife was alive launching a nationwide search for her 
The most common verbal indicators are subtle 
This renders the answer perceptual rather than factual and is often a red flag 
Theres no magic bullet for detecting lies but developing skills to ferret out deception is possible 
These skills will enhance anyones chances of avoiding victimization by scam artists in their professional and personal lives 
Controversial Oil Pipeline Plan to Be Rerouted After Threat of Delayed US Approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico angering unions while appeasing environmentalists the company seeking to build the pipeline says its willing to reroute the project to get it back on track 
TransCanada said Monday evening it will move the planned pipeline out of the environmentally sensitive Sandhills area of Nebraska and is confident the project will still win approval 
The company announced the decision at a news conference at the Nebraska Capitol 
TransCanada official Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident it will eventually get a pipeline approved albeit with a different route 
That comes after the State Departments announcement last week that it would delay a decision on a federal permit for the project until it studies new potential routes that avoid the Sandhills areas of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer a vast underground water supply 
Obama in a written statement last week described the decision as the State Departments call and expressed support for it 
To do so would require it crossing six states 
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are weighing legislation to force a move away from the Sand Hills region and Ogallala aquifer a major source of drinking water and irrigation 
The State Departments current Environmental Impact Study found the project would pose only limited adverse environmental impacts but the energy industry source said the departments inspector general has ordered a separate probe of the review process centering on two questions 
The other is whether a firm that was hired to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was tied to TransCanada 
Patti LaBelle Sued for Allegedly Causing Toddler to Vomit out of Fear

The climatic adversity slowed down the economy
During the first year of Mario Lopez Valdez management in Sinaloa increased the unemployment and the informality foreign investment declined and the economy was reduced 
Lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial for the economist Gerardo Lopez Cervantes director at the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the UAS the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly depending on the actions that the public policy has been taken 
Stopped Immigration
Lopez Cervantes said that in the increase of unemployment there is also a demographic factor 
Informality
In addition to the unemployment and informality another state labor reminder is represented by low wages the entity has the lowest wages in the country according to the records of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare 
Contraction of FDI
Debt
Reactions
For business representatives the first year of Mario Lopez Valdes government demonstrates a lack of capacity of the government 
Economic slowness
Lopez Loredo said that the events such as early frost this year stopped the state economy and its performance and growth were restricted 
Redefining the vocation
Work to Do
Coparmex President stressed the importance of establishing a future vision to guide better the efforts of the government 
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in its own manner of leading the public policy 
The General Attorney Office reported that the sentenced drug dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval for the crime against health in its variant of possession of marijuana for purposes of trade 
For these reasons the insured was put at the disposal of the Second District Court and the sentenced person continues to be a prisoner at the Center for Supporting the Legal Consequences of the Crime 
There must be made contributions to works
Although there is a commitment of the state authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources he said that the request was made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance Armando Villarreal to speed up the efforts so that the percentages that correspond to them to come as quickly as possible 
The replacement of analog with digital is one of the most important changes that has hit the world in recent years
A minority of four ministers including the President of the Court Juan Silva Meza considered that President Felipe Calderon did not exceed his authority by issuing a decree detailing the actions to take in order to achieve the transition to the digital terrestrial television 
With this result the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate was rejected for not meeting the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to pronounce on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree and this remains in force 
The sentence project prepared by the Minister Olga Snchez Cordero proposed to declare unconstitutional the decree because the regulation of radio and television materials is a power reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission Cofetel in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and law reserve 
Only Zaldivar Jorge Mario Pardo Margarita Luna and Snchez Cordero voted for the project 
With this argument both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to contradict the decree and to support the claims the minister Snchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all actions stipulated there regarding the digital transition 
In his speech the minister said he did not agree with the arguments of the project in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general rules the measures for the public administration to get prepared 
The replacement of analog to digital is one of the most important changes that have hit the world in recent years and results in a better utilization of the radioelectric spectrum better signal quality and more channels 
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world has now completed the digital transition and has done it through the executive despite of having highly specialized technical bodies 
There cannot be concluded that the government by issuing the contested decree that invades in any way the competence of the Congress is providing in the administrative area the observation of the laws issued by the Legislature he said 
As it will be recalled Michoacn did not authorize the Constitution or the Electoral Code of the State or the Electoral Justice Act since the Congress of the state approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for them to come into force in this electoral process and the Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication within the periods specified in the Law in the State Official Gazette arguing that he had some objections 
Thus the partial recount of one or more electoral boxes may occur in the assumptions that the results of the records do not match there is no record of the count on the record of the box or they are not included in the power of the president or when there are obvious errors or alterations of the minutes 
In addition the total count of the vote received in all boxes of the election may take place when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged candidate winner of the election in question and the one who has obtained the second place in the voting is equal to or less than one percentage point as long as at the beginning of the session there is a request of the representative of the party and or coalition that nominated the second of the mentioned candidates 
The total vote count will also be done if at the end of the ordinary calculation is established that the difference between the winner and the candidate placed on second position is equal to or less than one percentage point as long as there is a request of the representative of the political party whose candidate came on the second position case in which there will be excluded the electoral boxes that have been considered during the partial recount 
His last will
His ashes will be spread in the mountains of Zapalinam confirms the family 
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortes arrived in Saltillo his hometown this Sunday night on Monday there were carried out the reconnaissance and a requiem mass 
According to the family the last wish of the Lieutenant Colonel was his ashes to be spread in the mountains of Zapalinam 
After receiving a tribute together with the other persons who died in the accident the family of Bacio Cortes returned to the capital of Coahuila on the board of an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force the closest people attended the ceremony at the Campo Marte 
At noon the ashes of the Lieutenant Colonel arrived at the chapel located on the boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza where family and friends were coming 
Felipe Cortes Bacio left very young the city of Saltillo in order to enter the College of the Air in Zapopan Jalisco 
Some did not believe him they said that he got dizzy even in the truck but always wanted to fulfill his dream that of becoming a pilot 
The young man recalls that even when he was seven years old he traveled to Zapopan for the graduation of his relative so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life piloting an aircraft 
They give him a last farewell
Bacio Corts died the past days when the helicopter he piloted collapsed along with Secretary of the Provincial Government Jos Francisco Blake Mora and six others all officials of this department 
Three bodies are found left in the NL Cadereyta farm
Hours before the discovery the military authority presented in media eleven persons who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime 
Three men were found shot dead in different parts of the body and with the shot of grace in an abandoned farm of the municipality of Cadereyta Jimenez Nuevo Leon 
Several people who went through the site noted that in the countryhouse whose wall is beige with brown the gate was wide open 
Looking inward at about three meters they located the bodies of three people so they immediately gave notice to the corresponding authorities 
One of the men wore a yellow tshirt with black jeans with no shoes and near him there was one man with white under vest 
At almost one meter there was the body of another individual with red shirt and blue jeans 
The three were face down 
According to the data obtained there the three persons were killed in another place since there were no cases on the site 
On the fence of the country house there are legends directed from one organized crime group to another and there are several bullet holes in it and in the gate 
He is accused of clandestine burials in the municipalities of the General Teran China and Cadereyta 
Wednesday there will be formed the new Italian government
The appointed prime minister Mario Monti will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy in order to present the new government that will face the crisis that has put the country on the edge of an economic disaster
The designated Italian prime minister Mario Monti will meet Wednesday with the President of Italy in order to present the new government that will face the crisis that has put Italy on the edge of an economic disaster and has endangered the entire euro zone 
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti named on Sunday will meet on Wednesday with the president Giorgio Napolitano to confirm that he can form a government 
He is expected to present a cabinet composed largely of technocrats although it is unclear when the new executive will undertake the position 
Monti said the he will present to the president the results of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government 
Monti did not say explicitly that he could form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome 
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days much less than the normal while Italy fought a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of its debt to unsustainable levels 
The new administration led by the former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by the European leaders in order to regain the confidence in Italy 
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation 
Montis chances of success were considerably boosted by the support of the LDP party of Silvio Berlusconi who was forced to resign on Saturday due to the crisis 
The support of the LDP the largest party in Italy is significant because until now many of its members had opposed the government majority made of technocrats that Monti is forming 
Parliamentary support
Montis new government must have a strong parliamentary support for applying the reforms that are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms 
Any blockage or delay in their efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on the financial markets 
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by warning that a failure of Monti would be a disaster 
Monti began on Monday his consultations with the political parties unions and business groups as well as with youth and women organizations 
He will end his meeting on Tuesday night 
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis 
After a brief rest at the end of last week when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign the Italian debt costs have now reached critical levels between uncertainties about whether the new prime minister will succeed 
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet but the major parties insist that it must be made only of technicians an indication of his objections to a process forced by the financial pressure 
Political sources said that the mutual mistrust and disagreement between the parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures 
The familiarity of the Spanish is higher than that of the Ticos
Spanish football players playing in the AllStar League and in powerful clubs of the Premier League of England are during the year very active in league and local cup competitions and there are highlevel shocks in the European Cups and Champions League 
To this is added the Spanish Fury experience in complicated qualifications for Euro and World Cup 
The Ticos players however have a limited international experience in an area such as CONCACAF which is considered the lowest level within FIFA
The least

aposGoing to Costa Rica is a dream come trueapos
In an exclusive interview with Viva the bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium 
This was stated by the bassist and founding member Jeff Ament who spoke exclusively with Viva from Brazil last week 
This is an excerpt of the conversation whose full transcript is online in The Nation 
For your followers from Costa Rica is a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica Are you aware of what your fans are experiencing 
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too 
This is only our second time in South and Central America and so far has been great 
Ive been to Costa Rica only once on vacation it is a beautiful country and I think well be able to stay a few days there 
So we are excited to bring our music there 
I ask this because there is a kind of devotion to the band the fans live with intensity the days before the concert 
What do you say to your most fervent followers 
Thank you for staying with us through all these years 
Some people as regards your concert refer to it as the biggest show of the year 
Does this add a bit of pressure on your visit 
We had a few wonderful shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that this has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica 
Really we are very eager to play there 
We love this country we love to surf and the jungle for both things Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world 
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves for surfing 
We have many friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves here are incredible 
My friends are always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua along with Mexico these are great places to surf and thats how we learned about through people who love surfing 
Viewing the tour one can say that you have been making great shows with lots of songs 
What have you planned for the presentation in Costa Rica 
As we have never played there before then we have no restrictions on what we can do 
We will try to make the best show possible with a good variety of songs we will try to play a couple of songs of each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire 
You never repeat the repertoire 
How come 
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we have not been playing for a while this keeps us focused and keeps us surprised because it reminds us the reasons why we liked those songs and that we might have forgotten 
That makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also makes it more interesting for the people 
Looking back is it hard to believe all you have made 
Yes absolutely 
We count our blessings and we are very excited that we can continue making music together 
We all love each other and love making music 
We are fortunate to go to places in the world where we always wanted to go 
Things could not be better for us 
What does it mean for you having been a fundamental part of the rise of grunge 
It has always been an honor to be a part of that group of great bands 
We are good friends of the people of Soundgarden Mudhoney and Alice in Chains 
Its amazing when a movement arises from a group of friends and it is unusual 
From time to time arises a band of a city but it is much more strange when five or ten bands come out at the same time from the same city 
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group 
I still play with some of them from time to time 
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney we saw Soundgarden in its tour so we are fortunate to be friends with all of them and we are honored to be part of the Seattle sound that aroused 
It is also very strange that a band like yours remains united with the same members for so long 
First I think we are all lucky to be still alive and secondly we all care about the others 
We are all very close friends and thanks to this there have also been opened musical avenues that give each the freedom to experiment 
We trust each other with the music of each and this could not be better 
Your relationship to the word fame has not been easy but thanks to your success you have been able to do whatever you wanted 
How do you find a balance 
As we have grown it has been easier to find a balance 
We take care of not being too much on tour because it is easy to fall into this game of big crowds and people who love your music 
While one remembers that people are there for the music that reminds you that you must respect the music and what brought it without setting your mind on being famous and being a rock star something that none of us really cares about 
How do you remember your other project Manother Love Bone 
I think we write very good songs and at the beginning was a great thing 
We were a band for almost three years and never released an album until after the death of Andy Andrew Woods 
There were many frustrations because lasted so long and the most important thing is that we are still close friends of Bruce Fairweather and Greg Gilmore who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a picture I think of the incredible person that Andy was and how he made me laugh it was always a pleasure to go to work laugh talk about music and football and much more 
It was a remarkable man and we miss him 
The national band Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica 
Is it true that you know its work especially Eddie Vedder and thats why you chose it for the opening 
Yes the production sent us several videos proposals and that was the band that we liked most so were anxious to see what Las Robertas can offer live and should be very entertaining 
Why do you always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter live 
That is a question for Ed Eddie Vedder so I do not know 
He sings it and I think he does this with the first thing that comes to his mind 
As a bassist what are your influences 
There are so many 
Within the first that come to my mind are Geezer Butler John Entwistle CJ Ramone John Doe Paul McCartney Chuck Dukowski 
There are so many I could talk all afternoon about the bassists that I love 
How did Pearl Jam succeeded to maintain grunge relevant despite of not being any longer a fad 
I think all of us feel a bit disconnected from the word grunge 
When I think of it it reminds me of the bands I mentioned before like Mudhoney Soundgarden Nirvana and all that came at the same time and if it is important now I think its wonderful because it is music worth listening to and bands as Mudhoney are making now music better than ever 
At first your music had a darker content and now has become more positive 
How do you explain this change 
Its interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the album that may appear lighter but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe that are qualified as very dark although they can sound a little positive 
With both when Ed played them I cried when I heard them and these songs are profoundly dark 
I think that when you grow up and there was some trauma in your life and you lost a family member or friend these things start to influence your art and your music and these two songs certainly represent that for me 
Also I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark

The entity was created to prevent the fall on the margins of the society of untrained young men
To this there are added over a hundred jobs currently created for this social group 
The diverse political representation in the election time showed the unitary character of the work done by Trinijove 
Next to the president of the Generalitat Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol attended the ceremony the ex counselor of Socialist Education Ernest Maragall and the ex lieutenant of the mayor and current eco socialist Councilman Ricard Goma 
Also attended at the Fabra i Coats the actual Counselor for Social Welfare and Family Josep Llus Cleries and CEO of the social work of La Caixa Jaume Lanaspa 
The president gave Trinijove as an example for fighting against the bad circumstances and giving hope to people with difficulties 
An occupied farm where macro parties were given was evacuated
Twelve people left voluntarily yesterday at noon the property they were illegally occupying and where they organized macro parties that exasperated the neighborhood by court order without police intervention 
When the operation was finished the lock on the door was changed in order to prevent a repeat of the situation 
The first three floors were the scene of mass parties which lasted up to two days and exasperated the tenants 
In addition the owner of the disco had to respond to neighborhood complaints of noise while as she noted the noise was not caused by customers of the club but by the inhabitants of the squat and above all those attending the parties that were organized there which had increased in frequency and intensity in recent weeks as the angry neighbors said 
The City Police also confirmed that in recent weeks has received more complaints from neighbors about the situation 
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one floor of the building occupied but over the last few months the squatters had entered into all floors and in almost every floor and that in some of them occurred burglaries 
Also yesterday the members of the police evacuated a building in Nou Barris 
The four were arrested at the time 
Park or mountain 
The architects agree on the opportunity of the call beyond controversies over fees
The booklet defined the mountain as the great park of the metropolitan Barcelona 
Moreover it was accompanied by a comparison in figures with the New York Central Park 
The classification of Collserola as a natural park redounds in this idea 
The reference was not Central Park but Yellowstone with the wild boar on the role of Yogi Bear 
A door refers to the idea of the park no doubt 
Either that or someone wants to put gates to the field 
The question comes alone Collserola Park or mountain 
The competition both as for its merely organizational side as for its reflection on the city is a topic of conversation among all architects of Barcelona 
Its almost a recurrent theme to make use of when two members of this ancient lineage of elected persons recognize themselves in an elevator 
And this fact gives rise precisely to one of the few similarities between what three architects of Barcelona are saying and the academics which have been presented 
Miguel Roldan Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayona the competition is appropriate
Among other things for its great accessibility 
The first fear is the own delimitation of the borders where to build 
Otherwise a project for one of the gates can crash into the program and definition with the project of the architect of the next gate 
In your opinion the council should ensure that the band immediately above the Ronda de Dalt should provide in its entirety an area of equipment to conduct a smooth transition between the city and the green 
Casino forgives Jonas Larrazabal and this one will be free
After the bombing of Casino Royale Red Casino owner Sergio Gil Garcia made public a series of photographs and videos where allegedly Manuel Jonas required him to pay an economic fee so that the city hall of Monterrey allows the clandestine operation of the bet house 
After four hours before the Agent of the Public Ministry for Heritage Crimes he was transferred to the Temporary Jail located in the Old Neighborhood of the state capital 
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells boarding San Nicolas of Garza 
On Monday the legal representative of Red Casino Victor Aldo Garcia Gomez appeared before the judge Jos Luis Pecina to seek pardon for the regional mayors brother so that in the coming hours he might regain his freedom 
During the legal diligence the public prosecutor attached to the Court Ramiro Arias questioned Garcia Gomez whether he had repaired the damage and which of the partners of the betting house granted pardon although the lawyer tried to reserve the name 
The clerk of the court Jorge Yanez went to the jail of the municipality of San Nicolas of Garza to notify Jonah that he has been legally pardoned and his record will be filed 
Also he will notify him about the immediate release order issued by the judge 
The Secretary Dionisio Perez Jacome gives details of the crash where the Interior Minister Francisco Blake and seven others died 
The Ministry of Communications and Transportation MCT reported that the results obtained on the accident in which the Interior Secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven others died indicate that the helicopter hit directly the ground in complete structural integrity without the pilot attempting a forced landing 
During a press conference Dionisio Perez Jacome Minister of Communications and Transport said that before the aircraft took off the pilot found that weather conditions were suitable for the flight 
He also said that the investigations made in the area of impact do not report the appearance of pieces on the ground 
For now the secretary said it is a priority to have the results as soon as possible however the investigation may take several months or even one year 
Meanwhile Gilberto Lopez Meyer general director of Airports and Auxiliary Services said that at the time of the impact the Presidential helicopter was operating in cruising speed and that this happened in a soft ascending land 
At the press conference the owner of the SCT Perez Jacome listed six important elements in the investigation 
Visual flight 
According to the aviation regulations the flight was conducted under visual flight rules this means that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the ground 
Weather Conditions 
AICM reports were indicating suitable conditions for taking off as the aircraft moved towards the border area between Mexico City and Mexico State there were layers of clouds at low altitudes 
Selected routes 
It is likely that due to cloud conditions the crew has searched an area of lower elevation and greater visibility into the valley of Cuernavaca 
Location of the impact 
The coordinates of the impact and the last record of the aircraft radar match probably before the impact there was no loss of control or change in the flight direction 
Dispersion of wreckage on a small area 
The information available so far suggests that the impact occurred in a straight and lateral line 
The dispersion of the wreckage suggests that the helicopter struck the ground in conditions of structural integrity 
There was not detected evidence of fire or explosion 
On the area of the accident there remains undisclosed evidence in the wreckage of the craft some kind of explosion or fire 
Recent research results indicate it may have had multiple contacts with the ground 
The pictures show the sequence in which it dismantled along that journey 
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground 
After a thorough research in a wider area than the surrendered off area near the place the accident took place there have not been found scattered pieces of the aircraft which strengthens the assumption that the impact is presented in terms of structural integrity 
MSS announces a protocol for finding obesity gene
Social Security directs a research to find the gene for obesity in children and young people it is supported by specialists from the IPN
The Mexican Social Security Institute MSSI has announced that conducts a research to discover the gene for obesity in children and young people called the protocol of Genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescence which will provide counting on markers associated with overweight 
In a statement the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of Specialties Hospital XXI Century National Medical Center Miguel Cruz Lopez explained that it was integrated a multidisciplinary team of physicians nurses nutritionists and social workers 
The team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health NIPH and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies Cinvestav National Polytechnic Institute NPI 
He explained that the purpose of this research is to understand the components and the importance of genetics in relation to the development of obesity and identify in children and young Mexicans the risk factors for preventing the appearance of chronic degenerative diseases 
They will also be asked about physical activity and family hereditary history of disease in order to avoid risk factors that give rise to diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure 
He explained that on Saturday to all participants will be applied anthropometric measurements weight height and waist circumference blood pressure measurements and determination of glucose triglycerides cholesterol and insulin and genetic seeking to identify genes that are associated to childhood obesity 
Cruz Lopez said that this research reflects the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in children 
He said the justification for searching the markers is based on that the population of the country differs from other in its genetic history 
He explained that generally the genetics of obesity result in the inability to burn off the excess energy that we consume calories and which is stored as fat 
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is a comprehensive assessment of the children which can detect if they have any degree of overweight or obesity 
Even he said the presence of darkcolored folds acanthuses on the neck and forearm indicates the likelihood of suffering of metabolic disorders and even prediabetes 
The information is handled with confidentiality doctors deliver it in writing to the parents to whom they explain each of the measurements and changes in the lifestyle that have to be undertaken in order to prevent disease 
Cruz Lopez explained that there are three major components that cause overweight obesity and other chronic diseases sedentary lifestyle which is the lack of daily physical activity staying most of the day and watching TV and using means of transport instead of walking short distances 
Also it is due to the high caloric intake meaning and the increased consumption of sugary drinks carbohydrate tamales bread pizza hamburger etc with high fat and protein and genetics analyzed in this protocol 
UNAM asphalt would avoid potholes
Rafael Herrera a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry of UNAM develops polymermodified asphalt to produce a mixture with the best performance regardless of the environmental conditions and temperature
In his lecture A technological view of the pothole issued under the International Year of Chemistry announced that the laboratory he is responsible for is developing a polymer modified asphalt to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to the asphalt but with a better mechanical strength both at high and low temperatures 
Herrera Njera said that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot as some cities in the north to improve its performance and therefore the formation of potholes 
He explained that the asphalt the heavier oil part is a set of hydrocarbon molecules some of high molecular weight called asphaltenes and other of low molecular weight called maltenes which together give the road surface its viscoelastic characteristic behavior 
This means that the resistance of the street asphalt is not uniform but is modified during the day according to the environmental conditions and temperature said the specialist in chemical engineering 
CF researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible pavement which is composed of six layers of material out of which the last three involve the asphalt 
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt composed of small stones dipped into the asphalt and then compacted 
Each of the stones which compose this covering he said is dipped with asphalt 
When driving vehicles and generating effort it allows the forces to spread very well on the pavement 
If it were modified asphalt it would spread even better said the chemical engineer 
On the asphalt covering he added is placed a final layer called rolling covering which is made of a fine stone material meaning sand also dipped into the asphalt 
Since this is the layer that will be in contact with the wheels of the vehicle it must have a better mechanical strength than the asphalt covering and provide road friction 
As being the part of the pavement that will receive and diffuse the efforts the rolling covering also requires proper thickness and the material it is made of must be take into consideration 
The weather especially humidity and temperature variations are also a very important factor to consider especially water he said because it greatly affects the performance of the asphalt 
When the ground is wet water diffuses inside the covering and its hard to get out this causing a softening of all layers of the pavement and therefore the formation of potholes 
In the formation of a pothole he said the first to wear is the rolling covering and only after that is affected the asphalt but the damage does not happen instantly it is a process that should be attended at the first signs with appropriate maintenance programs 
Also a member of the National System of Researchers explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of potholes and therefore the thickness of each layer of the pavement should be always made in relation to the vehicle load and ensure this fulfillment in order to prevent the frequent formation of potholes 
Rafael Herrera said that there is still much to investigate and work to do on the asphalt for example asphalt emulsions which in other countries are already on the market and even help repair potholes with easiness and without using high temperatures 
What did the candidate of Valley lack to be the new Miss Colombia 
Analysis of the factors that affected Serna Melina Ramirez for not getting the crown of Miss Colombia 
Once again Cauca Valley remains with the desire of the crown of Miss Colombia 
This time Melina Ramirez Serna had to be content with being on the winning podium wearing the silver crown and the band that accredited her as the new princess of Colombia 
Now the big question many are asking is 
What was missing Because the result is the defeat of a big favorite who in each performance showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia not in vain she was elected Queen of the Police and Best Jolie Face of Vogue titles that were obtained by queens as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia 
To the questioner she answered
Among the launched hypotheses it is said that Valley got burned by favoritism 
And that was noted in her first appearance in swimsuit on the beach of Hilton and during her two shows at the evening coronation 
Although in both she looked confident it was noted that she lacked the strength and energy that Magdalena and Atlntico representatives did show 
In addition Valley lately avoided talking to the press and that was wrong 
Another hypothesis is that Valley failed to convince the jury about her interest in social work which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest 
This is why two days before the election the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were seeking a woman committed to the social needs of her country 
There is also a speculation that Valley sinned for her defects on the posterior and the fibrosis that could be seen on her abdomen but it is contradictory because the jury specifically chose her as the candidate natural beauty with the healthier body good nutrition and responsible physical work 
Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine considers that the error of the Valley of Cauca were the surgical interventions she suffered 
Her body was never her strong advantage and here is where she was punished 
For this award which for the first time is given by the National Beauty Contest after the swimsuit parade a cruel prophecy was fulfilled last night it was said that this was the flicker that Raymundo granted to Melina for not giving her the pleasure of taking the crown 
Reality or not the fact is that Melina today begins a year of reign not as sovereign but as a princess a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions designated by the National Competition itself 
However she will go down in history as one of the queens that despite her overwhelming passage through Cartagena found difficulties in getting the crown 
Such was the work of the person who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
The work of these officials is a key work 
At the beginning of his career Gonzalez worked in municipalities of Choc where he often had to go for more than five days in the jungle to reach the place where there were the bodies that should be identified 
The week of Eliazars operation against alias Alfonso Cano he was warned to take clothes only for three days 
Something big was coming 
On Friday night he went from Cauca with a helicopter to Palmira 
He knew he had to identify two corpses and one was suspected to be of the man who led the worlds oldest guerrilla so they asked him to take the ten print card of Guillermo Len Senz his real name 
However when he arrived with the research team to the site where the body was he did not recognize him by his physical appearance it was very different from that seen in the media 
He was without beard dressed as a farmer of the area without glasses and much thinner 
But the prints do not lie 
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass ink a paddle and a flashlight Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the card 
That same night the man from Puerto Tejada was asked to confirm the defense minister Juan Carlos Pinzn that it was the top leader of the FARC 
In search of the fingerprint
Many people do not know our work 
The fingerprinting science is an exact science without error which can be key solution in solving crimes 
Apart from the identification of bodies the fingerprinting specialists support research for crimes like theft and murder and confirm the identity of those captured 
When captured many criminals have fake cards or do not have papers 
We will take their fingerprint and seek them in the database 
The researcher said that in a case of theft he had to remove a piece of the wall of a house because in that place the thief had supported his hand on to take a safe full of jewels and money 
The prints can also rule out or confirm suspects in murder cases 
They have recently found a dead man with liquor bottles around him 
Through the investigation it was determined that a relative could be suspected of the crime and indeed a print on the bottle matched 
Although this does not guarantee that it was the murderer it places him it in the murder scene 
When they appear there is used a paddle or tape to lift them 
After that the prints are sent to Asif which is the criminal database or at the Registry 
He clarified that not everything is as shown in CSI television program 
Just as not everything that glitters is gold not everything you touch turns into a footprint 
However if it can be used the comparison is being made 
Hundreds of protesters were crowding round in front of Zuccotti square to camp 
A part of the protesters listened to the eviction order and moved to a nearby park 
The members of the movement Occupy Wall Street challenged on Tuesday the authorities of New York when trying to enter again under the protection of a court order in the Manhattan Square where they were evacuated at dawn when trying to occupy another park of the Big Apple 
At least for one hour they were able to occupy the place but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters although Bray could not confirm the precise number while telling Efe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed 
The organization ensures that there are several hundred people camped at that point where a delegation of religious leaders has already gone to show their support to the members of the movement trying to mediate with the police 
Meanwhile Zuccotti square which is a privately owned site remains closed waiting for a court hearing scheduled for this Tuesday in which to examine the legality of the evacuation of this morning 
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that because of that court order the city had suspended the reopening of the public space and protesters were informed however that local laws do not allow them to reinstall with camping shops and sleeping bags 
Pamela Anderson will be Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
In addition to Anderson and Peters the CTV Christmas special show features the Canadian singer Buble who at the end of March married in Buenos Aires the Argentinean model Luisana Lopilato and he is not a stranger as regards the controversy 
Japan reborn after the earthquake
Since last March the Japanese economy was paralyzed still recovering from the devastating earthquake resulting in a nuclear crisis the worst catastrophe suffered by the Nippon country since the Second World War 
The recovery can be explained in part by the recovery in the purchase of machinery to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and the following tsunami 
However the true revulsion of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse that invites taking advantage on the crisis to strengthenor rebuildinfrastructure using of gaps to grow from scratch 
The stigma of the yen
With a stronger currency the products are more expensive abroad a serious slap for a country whose economic line is determined by the health of large technological groups 
Toyota or Sony for example blamed the yen for their weak results between July and September 
As markets continue their siege of the peripheral countries of the EU the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not lower the guard 
And indeed the perspectives are not encouraging 
The Organization for Cooperation and Economic Development OECD said that most member countries showed in September clear signs of economic slowdown 
The indicator that anticipates the turning points in the global economy showed that the major powers are slowing 
Athens feeds back the doubts
Papademos said that adjustments will be approved but conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With peripheral risk subsidies launched and uncertainty reinstated in the parks Greece is still entangled in the maze that leads to the exit of the great European debt crisis 
The Greek hank still has a thread for the moment 
Finally the Queen Mrs Sofia concluded by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and find solutions to advance the fight against poverty 
CDU intends to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The future of Europe was not initially planned to be on the programme but imposed itself in the autumn in particular to satisfy the militants who will be watching the governments policy on Greece today and perhaps that on Italy tomorrow 
The motion on the preidency of the European Commission tabled by the directorate was adopted almost unanimously 
The standing ovation lasting several minutes which they Angela Merkel and then a few hours later Wolfgang Schuble the very Europhile Minister of Finance received at the end of their respective speeches left no room for doubt 
This is generally speaking the case of one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the congress whose inspiration clearly comes from Wolfgang Schuble 
Certainly it is not probable that the TwentySeven will rapidly agree to this solution Great Britain is opposed to it and the heads of CDU think that Nicolas Sarkozy is also opposed to it 
But the marker is in place 
Similarly the delegates rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weight the vote of each countryMember of the directorate of the European Central Bank according the size of its economy which would clearly increase the weight of the German economy 
Except when in a hole 
Recalling that two centuries ago Leipzig was the scene of a bloody battle 
In fact it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army 
What is sick leave fraud 
After allowances the UMP and the government are launching an offensive against sick leave 
And to help this offensive stemming from a desire to make economies in the context of constraints but which also forms part of the presidential reelection campaign the majority want to concentrate on sick leave 
First and foremost with a view to budgetary economies the government intends to impose on private employees a fourth day of unemployment before the start of unemployment benefit
And which would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic effect namely the imposition on public employees of one days wait for benefit payment in the case of sick leave public employees have not hitherto had to wait for the payment of benefit as against a three days wait by private employees 
Now that these questions are being discussed the majority are also relaunching the subject of fraud targeting abuses linked to medical certificates 
As in other cases the effects of the announcement appear a little disproportionate to the reality of medical certificaterelated fraud 
The French are no sicker than people elsewhere in Europe 
Let us first of all look at the national figures 
Comparing these figures with those of their European neighbours French employees are no more inclined to take sick leave than those in any other country 
As regards fraud it is very low 
Papademos Greece must implement a new adjustment plan
Greece needs a new programme of adjustment to rescue its economy 
The Right rejects new austerity measures
On Monday Antonis Samaras the leader of the Right gave his support to already approved measures to try and emerge from the debt crisis but warned that his party would not support additional austerity 
He declared his agreement with the objectives of reduction of the deficit and of the debt and of the struggle against waste but also his opposition to any policy which would prevent economic recovery 
It is necessary to legalise euthanasia and assisted suicide says a committee of experts
Canadians are living half dead according to a report of the Royal Society of Canada
Regarding palliative medicine the committee claims that governments healthcare institutions and doctors work together to provide the best possible palliative care apart from cancer cases 
Canadian society is half dead 
This is one the conclusions of an imposing report by the Royal Society of Canada in which six experts in different fields took part including ethics the law and medicine 
This committee recommends to the government to modify the criminal code so as to permit assisted suicide and euthanasia when it is elected by a patient deemed competent to make such a decision 
On the delicate question of euthanasia and assisted suicide the authors of the report arrive at conclusions which oppose the position of the Federal government which has already said that it does not wish to change anything in the criminal code concerning euthanasia and assisted suicide 
Now according to the experts who also reviewed the position of all countries where these actions have been legalised or decriminalised there is no proof that the aid decriminalisation involves abuses of application that is to say the practice of euthanasia or of assisted suicide on persons who are not competent or not consenting 
On the contrary affirmed during a teleconference Jocelyn Downie who submitted the report more such cases were found precisely in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalised 
Canadians in favour of euthanasia
And the legalisation of euthanasia would not result in sending a message that the life of aged or handicapped persons had less value 
Regarding the continuation or the withdrawal of nursing care of a patient the situation is less clear say the authors of the report 
They also suggest among their other recommendations that the penal code should state that legally valid withdrawal of nursing care is not criminal 
The committee of experts also requests that health professionals should be trained in the duty to respect a withdrawal of nursing care at the end of life without having to fear criminal prosecution 
Regarding palliative care the committee calls on governments nursing institutions and doctors to work together to provide the best possible palliative care and not only in cases of cancer 
Lastly concerning palliative sedation already widely used in Canadian health institutions the committee asks that it should be considered where it only serves to reduce physical pain as does euthanasia and that it should be subject to the same procedures 
Reservations of other experts
Certain experts in the field of the healthrelated legislation have already voiced reservations concerning the conclusions of the Royal Society of Canada experts report 
Me Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report appear to place the independence of the person above all other values which contribute to the fabric of society
Margaret Somerville who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada contests in particular the data of the report concerning abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have been legalised as in The Netherlands and in Oregon 
The King of Jordan calls on president Assad to relinquish power
Syria is becoming increasingly isolated
The partisans of Bachar alAssad demonstrated yesterday in front of the offices of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
Two days after the suspension of Syria from membership of the Arab League the European Union has reinforced its sanctions against Damascus whilst Syrias neighbours Turkey and Jordan came out in favour of president Assads departure 
King Abdallah II of Jordan yesterday became the first Arab leader to call on president Bachar alAssad to relinquish power in Syria where some forty civilians and members of the armed forces of the regime were killed 
In his turn the Turkish foreign minister Ahmet Davutoglu deplored the fact that Turkish efforts to mediate which began at the start of the year did not meet with success 
For their part the United States are congratulating themselves on the increased consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union 
Two other civilians died during exchanges of fire and heavy rifles at Jobar in the besieged town of Homs according tot his ONG 
Italy
Monti demands time from the markets and sacrifices from Italians
The former European commissioner was yesterday in discussions with the political parties before todays meeting with unions and employers
He will have to form a relatively moderate cabinet composed of technocrats from outside parliament 
The president of the Chamber or deputies Gianfranco Fini said that he would wait to learn if Mario Monti would ask parliament for a vote of confidence between now and Friday to ascertain whether the new government had enough support 
The consultations will end in the presentation by M Monti of a limited list of a dozen or so ministers to the head of State Giorgio Napolitano 
M Monti commented on the nervousness of the stockmarkets here asking them for time 
His appointment by the president was initially welcomed by the markets but disquiet reemerged in particular after an unexpected fall in industrial production in Eurozone in September 
According to the president of the Chamber of deputies Gianfranco Fini the new government would secure the vote of confidence of parliament by Friday 
M Monti undertook that once in office he would work hard to ensure that Italy would once again become a protagonist in Europe 
The great unknown is the longevity of his team 
A Russian scientist has assisted an Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist Vycheslav Danilenko assisted Iran to develop a detonator usable with a nuclear weapon confirmed on Monday an American agency specialising in the field of atomic hazard 
The Institute of Science of International Safety ISIS bases itself on the recent report from the International Atomic Safety Agency AIEA and other documents from this UNO agency to identify this researcher 
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race colour of skin religion origin and now sexual orientation 
Twitter modifies its platform and resembles Facebook
On Monday the microblog site Twitter introduced changes in the presentation of its platform to allow its users in particular to observe the activity of those whom they are monitoring which makes its service resemble that of Facebook 
This enables one to know if they cause messages to be monitored if they subscribe new accounts if they have favourite messages etc 
Twitter which has been known so far for being rather unintuitive and for its use of somewhat esoteric terms RT for reposting someone elses message followfriday for recommending following other users much to the delight of experienced users is thus opening itself to a wider audience by offering a user experience closer to those of popular social networks Facebook and Google 
Austria
Yoshihoko Noda
threatens fresh intervention on the exchange market
The Japanese prime minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would again intervene in the exchanges market if the value of the yen continued to rise 
This rise of the Japanese currency damages Japanese exports because it makes Japanese products more expensive and reduces the value of income of Japanese firms from abroad when converted into the national currency 
The minister of finance Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan BoJ which on Tuesday opened a twoday meeting of its monetary policy council to take every necessary step to weaken the yen 
Eurozone 
the rates are climbing the stock exchanges are wavering
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis is undermining European indices 
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and in Italy and better growth figures in France and in Germany the rates in fragile countries continue to rise 
This reemergence of disquiet about the future of Eurozone penalises the single currency which has continued to fall on Tuesday 
The Euro is reaching its lowest level for a month and a half 
According to brokers it fell after the party of the chancellor Angela Merkel the CDU meeting on Monday adopted a motion envisaging in particular the possibility of a country in difficulty leaving the Eurozone without also leaving the European Union 
The borrowing rates of Italy and Spain remain at very disquieting levels 
These tensions of the rates of interest of southern countries but also France continue to feed the apprehensions of participants 
The head of the future Italian government Mario Monti asked the markets for time to restore the situation in an Italy threatened by asphyxia by the weight of its debt 
Spain finds itself in the line of fire by the markets ahead of the parliamentary elections on Sunday 
Awaiting the growth figures of Eurozone
And it is really the fourth quarter which most disquiets the economists 
Energy policy 
Facts must prevail over dogmas
If there is a topic which cannot be dealt with via shortterm considerations or under the stress of emotion it is energy policy 
The availability and cost of electricity affect directly the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies 
It is healthy that an electoral rendezvous should be an occasion for reflecting on such stakes and the place occupied by nuclear power 
The debate will not be fruitful unless it explores all the economic social and environmental consequences of the proposed options 
The French must base their opinion on the objective facts of rational data 
During the same period it will become necessary to palliate the increasing shortage of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity permanently without forgetting the overriding need to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases to fight climatic imbalance a subject which has vanished from the ecological debate 
The Fukushima accident does not modify any of these parameters 
This is why Germany is isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear energy 
This is not the case of Belgium which subordinates its decision to the need to find a source able to replace nuclear energy or that of Switzerland which intends to build only the most modern ones 
The United States decided after Fukushima to add a unit to their range by resuming the construction of a centre which was interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident 
The choice of Berlin will result in a rise of the price of electricity an increased energy dependence aggravated by increased recourse to imported gas in particular from Russia a jump in carbon dioxide emissions due to the construction of gas and of coal centres 
In a few months all these adverse effects will already be felt 
The case of Denmark should be considered 
Since in the worldwide economy the cost of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a stake in the maintenance of the industrial tool in the national territory French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe 
Due to this any significant fall in the cost of nuclear energy would bring about a big rise of cost of electricity which would render illusory the fine declarations on reindustrialisation of our country and the protection of purchasing power 
A price which a large majority of the French refuse to pay all the more so since they do not object to this form of energy in principle 
Strongly exportoriented it attracts a galaxy of specialised RMEs in international markets and creates many jobs which cannot be moved elsewhere 
What electrician would recommend a EPR designed to function for sixty years if the decline of its manufacture was programmed 
To solve the energy equation it must be admitted that there is no miraculous or diabolical source of production of electricity 
The development by Areva of low carbon dioxide emission solutions nuclear and renewable bears witness to the complementary nature sources of energy 
For nuclear energy to maintain the highest level of safety is absolutely vital 
In France we have a safety authority which exercises an intransigent and transparent control of existing generation centres such as Flamanville 
Our teams whose professionalism is recognised are accustomed to the same safetyrelated obsession 
Only one Three Mile Island occurred under normal operating conditions but without any human or environmental consequences 
At Tchernobyl the design of the reactor and unforgivable human error brought about the drama 
At Fukushima some people appear to forget that the accident resulted from two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude which caused the death of tens of thousands of people 
The nuclear industry will draw lessons from this accident as it has from its two predecessors 
The fruit of this step and of cooperation between safety authorities the operators and French and German constructors the EPR presents a design enabling it to resist such phenomena 
Since it is being considered by all electricians wishing to construct a generation centre a decision to construct it at Flamanville would be a magnificent gift to the competitors of Areva and EDF by clearing their way to seizing the leadership of the unavoidable development of nuclear energy 
It is essential and legitimate to look for the best fan of energies for our country but it would be irresponsible to allow emotion dogmas and partisan manoeuvres to dominate the debate which is so decisive for the economic social and financial situation of our country 
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy 
Immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticised from various aspects a congestion of police legal and administrative services subjected to a policy of numbers and the compatibility of that policy with the selfproclaimed status of the country as the country of French human rights 
But it is only rarely analysed from the economic viewpoint 
There is a lot of consensus between the Left and the Right on this subject 
The only difference the degree of generosity
Both sides see immigrants as a burden on the French economy and on French society 
The only difference resides in the degree of generosity which one deigns to grant to immigrants 
This notion of immigration being a burden and a problem may be an electoral asset but it is economically very costly 
Restraining immigration leads to anaemic growth and harms employment 
Fears about the impact of immigrants are based on the notion that they are liable to replace native workers in particular unskilled ones exerting downward pressure on wages 
But experience shows that in reality immigrants are much more complementary to rather than replacements of local labour exercising trades in which there is a shortage of local labour 
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors which do not attract local labour and the most highly skilled ones in dynamic sectors where training does is not linked to offers of employment 
A positive effect on wages
In the same way as a surgeon would find it difficult to work in a country with a shortage of anaesthetists the complementarities existing between locals and immigrants bring it about that the arrival of immigrants has a positive effect on the pay of locals 
And does so without taking into account the fact that the diversity contributed by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and to economic growth a large proportion of naturalised immigrants are among American Nobel prizewinners whilst Google Intel Paypal eBay and Yahoo were all founded by immigrants 
The teeth in question intended to serve to dissuade immigrants had precisely the opposite effect 
Europe invented democracy thinks in terms of European democracy
Democracy is a precious possession it is also a fragile one 
The European continent should be able to remember that having invented it in Athens over two thousand years ago it experienced during the XXth century the tragedies of the World War of totalitarisms the Holocaust the gulag but also Franco in Spain Salazar in Portugal and the colonels in Greece 
Some believed that it was enough for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies to exercise the vote and to do so as directly as possible 
It is known that since the time of Napoleon it was a matter of faculty of thinking 
No democracy requires a lot more a public space a public spirit values an organisation a separation and control of powers education the Lumieres economic and social solidarity justice 
The European crisis which we are passing through is an economic crisis but it is primarily a political crisis and a crisis of democracy 
In this respect the palinode of a truefalse Greek referendum will have a double revelatory value that of a need of a powerful reversal of policy but also that of the worrying sentiment of its impossibility and of its incongruity 
This ambivalence must be thought through in order that it can be bypassed 
The truth is that the lines of the forefront of democratic struggle have now moved and that for many the republican soldiers are no longer firing in the right direction 
We have nothing to gain from demanding a succession of national referendums organised as required and in a confused sequence 
No we do not want the blades of a guillotine but an exercise joint serene and ongoing of choice and of democracy this time on European level 
There are no crises in Greece Italy Spain or Portugal and one would not know where to stop enumerating them because there is only a single crisis and that is in Europe 
It is the whole of Europe which defers to the dictates of the markets and of rating agencies who suffer from their incapacity and a lack of solidarity 
It is all Europe which is humiliated on the international scene 
There is disquiet about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe but it is the entire Europe which is gradually losing its sovereignty and with its each of its nations 
The urgency concerns the return to popular sovereignty the direction of the European project 
Because it is by all working together that Europeans will be able reduce the weight of their individual debts to free themselves from the markets and to prepare for the future by investing in it 
Emerging from the crisis will entail decisions on European level which cannot be made without total democratic legitimacy without leading us into disaster 
After having long fought this proposal by specialists and of Jacques Delors the whole world now calls for a European economic government 
Let is be so 
But the idea without stronger economic political and democratic integration and lived in such by citizens would be a fresh folly and a new impasse 
We must launch a new stage of European construction 
The Revolution of interests would not be enough 
This lesson remains valid 
We must construct a Europe integrated on economic level 
This can only be done by constructing a more democratic Europe on political level a real popular European sovereignty 
To make Europe let us make Europeans 
Chip maps without contacts become generalised
The worldwide chip map room opens on Tuesday at Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic atmosphere 
The most important sector is that of contactless technology which enables paying for common transport or paying for purchases simply by passing the card over a reader 
For a long time lagging behind the AsiaPacific region Europe is now gaining ground in contactless payment 
But the large stores are installing superfast slots 
To achieve higher speeds it is now necessary to equip their clients 
Banks are testing payment by mobile telephone
But this is only a first stage of the future mode of payment namely the mobile telephone 
Few apparatus are at present equipped with NFC technology Near Field Communication essential for implementing these transactions 
But the banks are forging ahead 
Yesterday Crdit Agricole announced a test to run from next December to June in Caen 
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and in Marseille 
And the Socit Gnrale also said yesterday that it is preparing the market launch of an offer enabling its clients to pay via their mobiles 
The terrorist front extends from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is disquieted by links between the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect 
Suspected for a long time the links between the terrorist group alQaida in the Islamic Maghreb Aqmi and the Nigerian Boko Haram sect have been confirmed 
On Sunday the Algerian deputy foreign minister Abdelkader Messahel even stated that Algiers is now certain 
Paris appears to make a similar analysis 
The inquiry into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger in January discovered two bridges 
The men kidnapped men in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqui Antoine de Locour and Vincent Delory had to be killed on the next day at the same time as several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by special French forces 
Among the rubble left behind by the action French and Nigerian investigators found several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists 
Terrorist axis
The analysis of calls exchanged indicates several interlocutors based in Mali in Niger and in Nigeria 
According to Radio France Internationale RFI two numbers interest the investigators in particular one leads to a Nigerian who lived for a long time in Maiduguri a town in Northern Nigeria the cradle of Boko Haram and the other to a man said to be close to Aqmi and to the sect 
In recent months this support became more and more evident from the developments and statements by Boko Haram and from its methods of operation which increasingly include resort to kamikazes and to increasingly complex explosive engines of the same type as those used by Aqmi 
The international community starting with Washington is now exerting pressure on Abuja to take into account the problems caused by Boko Haram 
Nigerian authorities have in fact long considered the group to be a community of enlightened persons not worthy of interest 
Rapid success
In this poor region the association is enjoying rapid success 
It is politicised and demands rigid respect of sharia whilst its militants engage in a struggle with the impious central government 
The latter target primarily churches bars and administrations 
The reaction of Abuja is as usual without light and shade 
Mohammed Yusuf arrested alive was killed in prison 
Now the sect will become radicalised and will leave its northern fiefs 
In June at Abuja Boko Haram takes a secured police QG during a suicide attack its first 
In August the local United Nations headquarters will be its first international target 
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa which will move from Mauritania to Somalia via Nigeria now disquiets all security specialists 
Now that Aqmi has invested Mali and Niger and the Somalis of alChebab operate in Kenya Boko Haram appears to be a new menace in the continent 
Last week during an interview in Nigeria with president Goodluck Jonathan Alain Jupp warned against Boko Haram and declared himself ready to share all intelligence 
The world according to the republican presidential candidates
Concerning China Iran aid to Israel Mitt Romney Herman Cain and Rick Perry compete in simplification and a lack of knowledge 
Can an America weakened by crisis lead a complex world by simple and indeed simplistic ideas 
To listen to republican presidential candidates the electors might believe it 
For some days Mitt Romney Herman Cain Rick Perry and the others multiply resounding and abbreviated foreign policy declarations which are traditionally a republican strong suit 
Concerning China Iran and aid to Israel the slogans are often fused together 
So much the worse if this should trigger a trade war he said 
Jon Huntsman Obamas former ambassador to China and the only candidate with a vision of a sophisticated foreign policy has failed to suppress an attitude which flatters the emotions 
He called for a muscular but a constructive dialogue with Peking the current position of Obama 
But Huntsman who is stagnating at the bottom of the polls remains inaudible 
In the style of Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions failed to stop its nuclear programme 
Hr also promised to increase military aid to Israel accusing Obama of failing in his obligations to wards that partner 
The entrepreneur Herman Cain the second bestplaced candidate declares an embarrassing lack of knowledge of the files 
The Texas governor Rick Perry who supports Israel and wants military strikes against Iran says that he is ready to involve the USA army in Mexico against the drug cartels 
The opponents of the current president reply that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the cold war 
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to water down his wine concerning antiterrorism 
But the attack is not so easy 
The population judges as positive Obamas the balance of national security which eliminated Bin Laden 
Since Iraq it distrusts military interventions which run into quicksands 
And in arguing that it is necessary to reconstruct America economically to revive its leadership Obama is right 
The North Stream a new portal for the entry of Russian gas into Europe
The North Stream gasduct connecting Western Europe and Russia directly along the bottom of the Baltic sea has been commissioned 
Symbolically the German Chancellor Angela Merkel the Russian president Dmitri Medvedev the French prime minister Franois Fillon and his Dutch opposite number Mark Rutte jointly turned the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the West European network 
And the possibility of constructing a third pipeline of the same course is already under discussion 
For Gazprom the completion on time of this huge project is a victory 
The project was fiercely competed for by Poland and the Baltic States 
The North Stream will in fact allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany avoiding any passage via a third country Poland or the Ukraine 
These two countries will lose some of their power it will become more difficult for them to influence Russia by threatening to close access to West European markets 
That is to say that the topic is politically sensitive 
By supporting this Russian project Western Europe is gaining greater security for its supplies 
But at the price of depriving Europe of energy since the project has created a breach between eastern and western Europe 
Russia has succeeded in less than five years in achieving its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the the rich Western countries which consume large quantities of gas and whose deposits are declining 
All this explains the broad smiles on the faces of the heads of Gazprom present in large numbers at Lubmin the point of arrival of the gas 
The construction of this gasduct is also a technical exploit 
The undersea pipeline is made of steel embedded in concrete in order to protect it from ships anchors 
To construct it it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to the second World War 
It was also necessary to multiply steps of protecting the fauna and the flora 
A control platform was provided on the level of Sweden but the project managers abandoned it since the Swedes were not keen on seeing a Russian State company becoming permanently on its shores 
In the case of a leak the gas contained in the gasduct therefore escapes into the air 
The surveillance of the state of the gasduct is provided by an undersea robot pulled by a ship for outside observation as well as by an apparatus circulating within the gasduct 
The gas circulation is implemented simply by its pressure 
Five companies combined their forces to implement this project 
These five companies have created a joint enterprise called North Stream delegated to construct and to operate the gasduct 
It has its headquarters at Zug in Switzerland where taxation is particularly favourable 
Gazprom next leased to this company for twenty renewable years the entire capacity of gas transport 
But the minority shareholders are certain to recover their costs since Gazprom assumes the entire risk 
The gasduct emerges from the Baltic sea at Lubmin on a sandy littoral planted with conifers 
Sensors measure pressure temperature and the specific gravities of arriving gas before being transferred into German gasducts 
Since last Tuesday the terminal has been receiving one million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour 
Moleskine a brand card 
Created fifteen years ago by an Italian company Moleskine will restore the taste of writing 
It is a scent of adventure of hours sent in writing by a the light of a candle 
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognised by its black rectangular cover its elastic its broken white pages as if aged over time 
The Italian company Modo Modo based in Milan decided to launch a designer notebook 
Maria Sebregondi then a consultant of the company has assumed responsibility for the launch of the new product 
The notebook draws its inspiration from an old production technique the mole skin which means varnished cotton used for covering benches for example 
This type of notebook is said to be highly prized by writers and travellers 
Success is there 
It is difficult to establish a profile of the typical purchaser because the notebook attracts equally a businessman a student and a professional 
Moleskine consumers are cosmopolitan openminded and cultivated 
Its distributes its notebooks to Fnac libraries small shops in town centres and has succeeded in becoming well known 
In August it also launched a leopardskin pattern cover on the occasion of the Film Festival in Locarno 
Exploiting its success and the cultural aura Moleskine diversified its products to include handbags pens computer bags The brand includes every kind of support 
Why is the rate of unemployment of handicapped workers so high 
Discouraging 
It must be said that for the handicapped the obstacles to obtaining employment are still many 
Here are some of the brakes 
It is hardly necessary to speak about mentalities which do change but too slowly 
We do not go so far as to say that there was connivance between them but the image is symbolic 
Sitting side by side on the tribune of the auditorium of the Stade de France Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard made peace 
Five months following the gesture of humour of his attacker against Turkey the Belgian selector can only be praised 
This necessarily participates in strengthening even more the particular character of this match 
Portugal is very confident
On their way there both teams appeared to lack realism 
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and in the Ukraine 
But there is match to play and an opponent Bosnia to conquer 
Whilst Portugal dominated the match for over one hour it was not able to reach this precious target which would have consoled it 
The zero taken on Friday from Bosnia obliges the Portuguese to win 
A zero may be sufficient for the Bosnians 
A good idea provided that it will prove realistic this time
