Proposal (2 pages max):

Define the input-output behavior of the system and the scope of the project.
- Input: Encrypted text 
- Output: Decrypted Text
- Scope: English. Encrypted using substitution cypher.

What is your evaluation metric for success? 
- How many of the 26 letters were substituted correctly?
- Edit Distance
- Weighted substitution error
- Likelyhood of the language model of output

Collect some preliminary data, and give concrete examples of inputs and outputs.
- gfd => the


Implement a baseline and an oracle and discuss the gap.
    Baseline:
        Get the counts of words from the corpus and calculate frequencies of letters.
        Calculate the frequencies of letters in the input and map them to the known frequencies from the corpus.
        Use mapping as decryption for substitution cipher.
    Oracle:
        Knows Correct Answer
        Or a human goes through all 26! possible answers
        Or really good code breaker

What are the challenges? Which topics (e.g., search, MDPs, etc.) might be able to address those challenges (at a high-level, since we haven't covered any techniques in detail at this point)? 
    Figuring out best substitution for letters
    Distinguishing meaningful sentence from random english words
    Holes in the fact that training corpus isnâ€™t entirety of english language so n-gram language models will have missing features from training.

    Search will help address challenges related to obtaining meaningful sentences

You should basically have all the infrastructure (e.g., building a simulator, cleaning data) completed to do something interesting by now.
